Dazzled by the light, he painted with rich colors of vermilion, emerald, and violet. His poppies, tulips, irises, and waterlilies have awed the world. In her radiant watercolors, Bijou Le Tord uses Monet&#39;s own palette of only eight colors. Her magnificent paintings and poetic words celebrate the extraordinary vision of the beloved impressionist painter, Claude Monet.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 4?A short narrative highlighting Monet's painting is brought to life by Le Tord's impressionistlike illustrations of the artist and some of his most notable subjects. She comments that she was careful to use Monet's limited palette in her own pictures?not an easy accomplishment, since he claimed to use only eight colors. Le Tord portrays Monet as he was in his later, prosperous years?with a white beard and straw hat, sitting in his garden or in farmers' fields in front of his easel. In her brief, lyrical text, she describes the beauty of his paintings and his single-minded dedication to his art (while not mentioning his famous temper). His dazzling use of light is likened to a blue butterfly that he holds on his brush for just an instant. Le Tord's luminescent watercolors "paraphrase" some of Monet's well-known works, such as Rouen Cathedral and the waterlilies at Giverny, and place them, within this story-biography, in an accessible context for young children. A Blue Butterfly stands alone as a lovely first look at Monet and would also work well as a companion to Christina Bjork's Linnea in Monet's Garden (R&amp;S, 1987), which gives many more details about the painter and his family.?Linda Wicher, Highland Park Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5^-8. Not so much a story about Monet (as the subtitle states) as a tribute to him, this picture book uses the colors of his palette and reflections on his work as the basis for a picture book. The often poetic text extends vertically down each page like free verse: "Monet / painted / as / a / bird / sings, / for / himself." The watercolor paintings, which sometimes include the figure of the artist, suggest Monet's paintings without slavishly copying them. Although the most enthusiastic audience for this book (like M. B. Goffstein's picture books about artists) may be adult, it would be an interesting choice to share with a child before visiting a Monet exhibit or to read to a school class as part of a "picture person" presentation. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah</h2><p>Studies the formation and meaning of the Mishnah, a collection of Jewish halakic traditions first compiled around 200 A.D</p><p>Jacob Neusner was the Research Professor of Theology at Bard College and Senior Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Theology at Bard.

Its majestic landmarks are in ruins. Oceans and boundaries offer no protection. It is the first sophisticated, intelligently planned, and utterly ruthless terrorist campaign waged on U.S. soil. As national leaders, armies, and artificial intelligence strive to win the unconventional war, two men--once friends, now adversaries to the death--race to a decisive confrontation.</p><p>What if a foreign rogue nation launched a war against the United States within its own borders? America&#39;s largest cities are in flames. Its majestic landmarks are in ruins. Electronic sabotage cripples its far-flung communications systems. Race battles against race in a raging civil conflagration. The first waves of a meticulously orchestrated international terrorist campaign have achieved a stunning and terrifying success. As grim national leaders hunker down with advisors, as the finest living minds in strategic intelligence together with state-of-the-art computers link up to search out and destroy the source of the savagery, as armies both with and without uniforms mobilize to win the ultimate unconventional war, two men - once friends, now adversaries to the death - race to a decisive confrontation. On one side is General Amir Taleh, an implacable foe of the United States, a nimble survivor of the brutal cross-currents of Iran&#39;s internal politics, and a shrewd fighter who believes that killing for revenge is pointless but killing for a higher purpose is justified. Opposing him are two American operatives who become tactical allies as well as unexpected lovers: Colonel Peter Thorn, the Delta Force veteran who has faced down the masters of terror on foreign soil and now feels powerless to defeat them at home; and Special Agent Helen Gray, as beautiful as she is a formidable player in the old-boy network of special operations. Together, they must find a way to defeat Taleh and his forces before the West awakens to its greatest nightmare of all.Larry Bond is a former anti-submarine technology expert and naval intelligence officer.

Her discovery, which she published in Before Writing: From Counting to Cuneiform and How Writing Came About, was widely reported in professional journals and the popular press. In 1999, American Scientist chose How Writing Came About as one of the "100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science."</p><p>In When Writing Met Art, Schmandt-Besserat expands her history of writing into the visual realm of communication. Using examples of ancient Near Eastern writing and masterpieces of art, she shows that between 3500 and 3000 BC the conventions of writing&#x2014;everything from its linear organization to its semantic use of the form, size, order, and placement of signs&#x2014;spread to the making of art, resulting in artworks that presented complex visual narratives in place of the repetitive motifs found on preliterate art objects. Schmandt-Besserat then demonstrates art's reciprocal impact on the development of writing. She shows how, beginning in 2700-2600 BC, the inclusion of inscriptions on funerary and votive art objects emancipated writing from its original accounting function. To fulfill its new role, writing evolved to replicate speech; this in turn made it possible to compile, organize, and synthesize unlimited amounts of information; and to preserve and disseminate information across time and space.</p><p>Schmandt-Besserat's pioneering investigation of the interface between writing and art documents a key turning point in human history, when two of our most fundamental information media reciprocally multiplied their capacities to communicate. When writing met art, literate civilization was born.</p></p><p>DENISE SCHMANDT-BESSERAT is Professor Emerita of Art and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Her work on the origins of writing has been covered by Scientific American, Time, Life, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the Christian Science Monitor, among other publications. She has also appeared on television programs such as Out of the Past (Discovery Channel), Discover (Disney Channel), The Nature of Things (CBC), Search for Solutions (PBS), and Tell the Truth (NBC).</p><h2>The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature</h2><p>This collection of satirical essays by the wildly clever Neal Pollack was among the first books published by McSweeney&#39;s. The author fabricates for himself a super-inflated ego, and goes on to apply that persona&#39;s preposterously offensive and short-sighted opinions to issues ranging from race relations to wild teenagers, but more than anything else, to his own (albeit fictional) stunning accomplishments.</p><p>It should come as no surprise that <i>The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature</i> is the inaugural title from McSweeney's Books, the publishing arm of Dave Eggers's literary quarterly <i>McSweeney's</i>. There appears to be two Neal Pollacks at work in the literary world. There's the legendary award-winning writer who has covered such global crises as the Spanish Civil War and 1999's "Battle in Seattle"; who has been married multiple times and romantically linked to Lara Flynn Boyle and Zadie Smith; and who counts Bishop Desmond Tutu and the Utah Jazz's Karl Malone among his closest friends. Then there's the <i>real</i> Neal Pollack, the young writer responsible for this comical tribute to the hard-drinking, fistfighting, wounded White Male egos behind the banged-up typewriters of first-person journalism. The high jinks begin in the table of contents, with such bloated chapter headings as "The Burden of Internet Celebrity" and "Why Am I So Handsome?"--hinting at what's to come. There's a detailed chronology included ("1959: Goes to Hollywood. Blacklisted.") and a nifty <i>Zelig</i>-like collection of photographs capturing Pollack (shirtless, more often than not, in his khaki photojournalist vest and aviator shades) yachting with J.F.K.; posing with a mud-caked platoon in Vietnam; and tuxedoed, escorting Mia Farrow to Truman Capote's Black and White Ball. Highlights include a transcript of Pollack's surprise appearance during a 1996 taping of Oprah's "other favorite author," Toni Morrison, where he offers this nugget to readers: "Oprah expanded my readership like no television program ever; not even my brief stint on <i>Laugh-In</i> gave me such wide exposure to Ma and Pa United States." Despite the one-joke tone of this slim volume, Pollack's clever wit prevails throughout, leaving a highly entertaining satire in its wake. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i><p>Neal Pollack is the author of the bestselling memoir <em>Alternadad</em> and several books of satirical fiction, including <em>The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature</em> and the rock novel <em>Never Mind the Pollacks</em>.

She was first inspired to write when she unearthed a machine gun in her garden&#x2014;one used in the events that unfolded during World War II on the island.Day by day the story unfolds, and as it intertwines with Angelika&#39;s wedding preparations, the secrets are revealed, feuds revisited and three generations of women reunited. * People&#39;s Friend * We race to the end with our hearts thumping. Full of local colour and tradition this is a little slow to start but certainly builds to unexpected conclusions. Terrific stuff. * Love Reading * This is a beautiful, heartbreaking story of sacrifice and love in the face of evil * For The Love of Books * Island of Secrets is a book full of raw emotions, family vendettas, hidden secrets and three very strong women. It&#39;s a book I enjoyed very much and one which fans of Victoria Hislop and Debbie Rix are sure to enjoy. * That Thing She Reads * The real highlight for me was the events of WWII and the Greek culture in a small village . . . an eye opening story about the events that occurred during the war. It is yet one more piece of the puzzle for me as the reader to have the opportunity to learn about how it impacted others. I still feel haunted regarding this fact long after reading the last sentence. * Twin Spin * Patricia Wilson deserves great praise for weaving such a fascinating, gripping story that left me gasping in horror at times with tears in my eyes but also a deep respect for the characters and their story. I&#39;m sorry I read it so quickly because I know now I will never experience that feeling of reading such a wonderful book as this was for the first time again. Island of Secrets is a moving, emotional, engrossing story that was written with such intensity and honesty and I loved every minute of it. It&#39;s already one of my books of 2017 and I am so glad to have discovered the writing of Patricia Wilson and hope there is many more books to come in the future if they are anything of this calibre I really can&#39;t wait. * Shaz&#39;s Book Blog * I couldn&#39;t believe that this was a debut novel, the writing is very descriptive and it almost feels like you are there in the thick of it, I loved it. Maria&#39;s story is heart-breaking and I was in tears it was sad but then it is uplifting too. * Echoes in an Empty Room * I was engrossed and hanging on each and every word. This book will leave a lasting impression on me and will be one that I will find myself recommending to everyone I meet. * Rea&#39;s Book Reviews * The author uses such powerful descriptions and language that I felt as though I was actually living the story and I was a silent observer. The descriptions of Crete made the place sound so beautiful that I really do want to visit there. If you haven&#39;t already guessed, I absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book and I really would strongly recommend that you read this book. I can&#39;t wait to read more from this hugely talented author. * Ginger Book Geek * The plot is unpredictable from start to finish so I was engrossed and hanging on each and every word. This book will leave a lasting impression on me and will be one that I will find myself recommending to everyone I meet. SO YES fans of Victoria Hislop you will love this book! This will easily be in my top 5 reads at the end of the year. * Rea Book Reviews * Our July choice Island of Secrets by Patricia Wilson was a good summer read, with it&#39;s sunny Cretan location, and book club members loved the WWII historical detail and the evocative description of the Greek island. * Henpicked, Book of the Month * The author did an amazing job with her research and her attention to detail is second to none... I cannot praise this book enough and just hope that the author writes another book soon * Boon&#39;s Bookcase * It is a very dramatic novel, one you cannot put down and a hugely enjoyable read * South Wales Argus *</p><h2>California Capers: Trouble Up Finny&#39;s Nose/Fog Over Finny&#39;s Nose/Treasure Under Finny&#39;s Nose (Finny&#39;s Nose Mystery Series Omnibus) (America Loves a Mystery: California)</h2><p><p>Take a fictional vacation through three novels to Finny, California, where at first glance it looks like any other coastal tourist village.

Since the publication in 1924 of the &#34;Methoden der mathematischen Physik&#34; by Courant and Hilbert, there has been no other comprehensive and up-to-date publication presenting the mathematical tools needed in applications of mathematics in directly implementable form. The advent of large computers has in the meantime revolutionised methods of computation and made this gap in the literature intolerable: the objective of the present work is to fill just this gap. Many phenomena in physical mathematics may be modeled by a system of partial differential equations in distributed systems: a model here means a set of equations, which together with given boundary data and, if the phenomenon is evolving in time, initial data, defines the system. The advent of high-speed computers has made it possible for the first time to calculate values from models accurately and rapidly. Researchers and engineers thus have a crucial means of using numerical results to modify and adapt arguments and experiments along the way. Every facet of technical and industrial activity has been affected by these developments. Modeling by distributed systems now also supports work in many areas of physics (plasmas, new materials, astrophysics, geophysics), chemistry and mechanics and is finding increasing use in the life sciences.</p><p></p><h2>Illustrated Key to Skulls of Genera of North American Land Mammals</h2><p>Illustrated Key to Skulls of Genera of North American Land Mammals is a manual that contains illustrations of North American land mammals such as marsupials, shrews, bats, moles among many others. This manual is a well-illustrated key, useful for identifying mammals through cranial characteristics. It also contains line-drawings, and many photographs to aid in identifying related genera. The distribution, diversity, and characteristics of each order and family of land mammals found in North American and to the north of Mexico are briefly discussed. <br><br>J.

The subject of a just released biography by Tracy Kidder, Farmer is the author of The Uses of Haiti, Infections and Inequalities, and AIDS and Accusation. Greg Bates is Publisher at Common Courage Press.In this impassioned, sometimes unwieldly, synthesis of history and report, Harvard-based Farmer, who alternates research with medical practice in rural Haiti, offers an indictment of American policy. He traces Haiti's long standing injustice from the sufferings of the 18th century slave economy, and the post-revolution establishment of a still-persistent feudal economy to the U.S. Marine invasion in 1915 and our subsequent support, based on business interests and anticommunism, for tyrants like Papa Doc Duvalier. The democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide was deposed in a 1991 coup shortly after he began to redress Haiti's ugly inequalities; Farmer (AIDS and Accusation) notes how media reports meshed with the Bush administration's line, and criticizes the Clinton administration's inaction. Departing from his historical narrative, Farmer also decries harassing U.S. policy toward Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; describes the torture death of a peasant as an outgrowth of U.S. military training; and suggests that AIDS in Haiti should not be blamed on images of squalor, but more on "an established political and economic crisis." American remorse, he suggests, would be the first step toward a new commitment to justice. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wild Wheels (The Hardy Boys Casefiles #104)</h2><p>Befriending beautiful, daredevil motorcyclist Lindsey Nichols, Frank and Joe learn that Lindsey&#39;s father is planning to put a classic bike back on the market in a high-stakes corporate dispute that soon reaches explosive proportions.

But at the center of every de Lint story is the miracle of the human heart.<br><br>And at the heart of <i>Spirits in the Wires</i> are Saskia Madding and Christiana Tree, both of whom are tied to perennial Newford character, the writer Christy Riddell. Are either Saskia or Christiana real? Christy's girlfriend, Saskia, believes she was born in a Web site, while Christiana is Christy's "shadow-self"--all the parts of him that he cast out when he was seven years old. <br><br>At a popular Newford on-line research and library Web site called the Wordwood, a mysterious "crash" occurs. Everyone visiting the site at the moment of the crash vanishes from where they were sitting in front of their computers. Saskia disappears right before Christy's eyes, along with countless others.<br><br>Now Christy and his companions must journey into Newford's otherworld, where the Wordwood, it transpires, has a physical presence of its own...to rescue their missing friends and loved ones and to set this viral spirit right before it causes further harm.<br></p><p>Born in Holland in 1951, Charles de Lint grew up in Canada, with a few years off in Turkey, Lebanon, and Switzerland. <br><br>Although his first novel was 1984's <i>The Riddle of the Wren</i>, it was with<i> Moonheart</i>, published later that same year, that de Lint made his mark, and established him at the forefront of "urban fantasy," modern fantasy storytelling set on contemporary city streets. <i> Moonheart </i>was set in and around "Newford," an imaginary modern North American city, and many of de Lint's subsequent novels have been set in Newford as well, with a growing cast of characters who weave their way in and out of the stories. The Newford novels include<i> Spirit Walk, Memory and Dream, Trader, Someplace To Be Flying, Forests of the Heart, The Onion Girl, </i>and<i> Spirits in the Wires</i>. In addition, de Lint has published several collections of Newford short stories, including <i>Moonlight and Vines</i>, for which he won the World Fantasy Award. Among de Lint's many other novels are <i>Mulengro, Jack the Giant-Killer, </i>and<i> The Little Country</i>.<br><br>Married since 1980 to his fellow musician MaryAnn Harris, Charles de Lint lives in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. <br>First Meeting<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Don't make of us</i><br><i>more than we are,</i><br><i>she said.</i><br><i>We hold no great secret</i>...<br>--SASKIA MADDING,<i></i><br>"Arabesque" (<i>Moths and Wasps</i>, 1997)<br>Christiana Tree<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"I feel as if I should know you," Saskia Madding says as she approaches my chair.<br>She's been darting glances in my direction from across the caf� for about fifteen minutes now and I was wondering when she'd finally come over.<br>I saw her when I first came in, sitting to the right of the door at a window table, nursing a tall cup of chai tea. She'd been writing in a small, leather-bound book, fountain pen in one hand, the other holding back the spill of blonde hair that would otherwise fall into her eyes. She looked up when I came in and showed no sign of recognition, but since then she's been studying me whenever she thinks I'm not paying attention to her.<br>"You do know me," I tell her. "I'm pieces of your boyfriend--the ones he didn't want when he was a kid."<br>She gives me a puzzled look, though I can see a kind of understanding start up in the back of those pretty, sea-blue eyes of hers.<br>"You--are you the woman in his journals?" she asks. "The one he calls Mystery?"<br>I smile. "That's me. The shadow of himself."<br>"I didn't... "<br>"Know I was real?" I finish for her when her voice trails off.<br>She shakes her head. "No. I just didn't expect to ever see you in a place like this."<br>"I like coffee."<br>"I meant someplace so mundane."<br>"Ah. So you've made note of all those romantic flights of fancy he puts in those journals of his." I close my eyes, shuffling through pages of memory until I find one of them. "'I can see her standing among the brambles and thorns of some half-forgotten hedgerow in a green bridal dress, her red hair set aflame by the setting sun, her eyes dark with mysteries and stories, a wooden hare's mask dangling from one languid hand. This is how I always see her. In the hidden and secret places, her business there incomprehensible yet obviously perfectly suited to her curious, evasive nature.'"<br>I get a smile from Saskia, but I don't know if it's from the passage I've quoted, or because I'm mimicking Christy's voice as I repeat the words.<br>"That's a new one," she says. "He hasn't read it to me yet."<br>"You wait for him to read them to you?"<br>"Of course. I would never go prying..." She pauses and gives me a considering look. "When do you read them?"<br>I shrug. "Oh, you know. Whenever. I don't really sleep, so sometimes when I get bored late at night I come by and sit in his study for awhile to read what he's been thinking about lately."<br>"You're as bad as the crow girls."<br>"I'll take that as a compliment."<br>"Mmm." She studies me for a moment before adding, "You don't read my journals do you?"<br>I muster a properly offended look, though it's not that I wouldn't. I just haven't. Yet.<br>"I'm sorry," she says. "Of course you wouldn't. We don't have the same connection as you and Christy do."<br>"Does that connection bother you?"<br>She shakes her head. "That would be like being bothered by his having Geordie for a brother. You're more like family--albeit the twin sister who only comes creeping by to visit in the middle of the night when we're both asleep."<br>I shrug, but I don't apologize.<br>"I'm only his shadow," I say.<br>She studies me again, those sea-blue eyes of hers looking deep into mine.<br>"I don't think so," she says. "You're real now."<br>That makes me smile.<br>"As real as I am, anyway," she adds.<br>My smile fades as I see the troubled look that comes over her. I forget that her own exotic origins are no more than a dream to her most of the time--a dream that makes her uncomfortable, uneasy in her skin. I wish I hadn't reminded her of it, but she puts it away and brings the conversation back to me.<br>"Why won't you tell Christy your name?" she asks.<br>"Because that would let him put me in a box labeled 'This is Christiana' and I don't want to be locked into who he thinks I am. The way he writes about me is bad enough. If he had a name to go with it he might be able to fix it so that I could never change and grow."<br>"He does like his routines," she says.<br>I nod. "His picture's in the dictionary, right beside the word."<br>We share a moment's silence, then she cocks her a head, just a little.<br>"So your name's Christiana?" she asks.<br>"I call myself Christiana Tree."<br>That brings back a genuine smile.<br>"So that would make you Miss Tree," she says.<br>I'm impressed at how quickly she got it as I offer her my hand.<br>"In the flesh," I tell her. "Pleased to meet you."<br>"But that's only what you call yourself," she says as she shakes my hand.<br>"We all have our secrets."<br>"Or we wouldn't be mysteries."<br>"That, too."<br>She's been sitting on her haunches beside the easy chair I commandeered as soon as I'd picked up my coffee and sticky-bun from the counter, leaning her arms on one of the chair's fat arms. There's another chair nearby, occupied by a boy in his late teens with blue hair and razor-thin features. He's been listening to his Walkman loud enough for me to identify the music as rap, though I can't make out any words, and flipping through one of the caf�'s freebie newspapers while he drinks his coffee. He gets up now and I give a vague wave to the vacant chair with my hand.<br>"Why don't you get more comfortable," I say to Saskia.<br>She nods. "Just let me get my stuff."<br>Some office drone in a tailored business suit, tie loose, top shirt button undone, approaches the chair while Saskia collects her things. I put my scuffed brown leather work boots up on its cushions and give him a sugar and icicle smile--you know, it looks sweet, but there's a chill in it. He's like a cat as he casually steers himself off through the tables and takes a hard-back chair at one of the small counters that enclose the caf�'s various rustic wooden support beams, making it look like that's what he was aiming for all along.<br>Saskia returns. She drops her jacket on the back of the chair, puts her knapsack on the floor, and settles down, tea in hand.<br>"So, what were you writing?" I ask.<br>She shrugs. "This and that. I just like playing with words. Sometimes they become something--a journal entry, a poem. Sometimes I'm just following words to see where they go."<br>"And where do they go?"<br>"Anyplace and everyplace."<br>She pauses for a moment and has a sip of her tea, sets the cup down on the low table between us. Later I realize she was just deciding whether to go on and tell me what she now does.<br>"You know, we're like words," she says. "You and me. We're like ghost words."<br>I have to smile. I'm beginning to understand why Christy cares about her the way he does. She's a sweet, pretty blonde, but she doesn't fit into any sort of a tidy descriptive package. Her thinking's all over the place, from serious to whimsical, or even some combination of the two. I think I just might have a poke through her journals the next time I'm in their apartment and they're both asleep. I'd like to know more about her--not just what she has to say, but what she thinks when there's nobody supposed to be listening.<br>"Okay," I say. "I'll bite. What are ghost words?"<br>"They're words that don't really exist. They come about through the mistakes of editors and printers and bad proofreaders, and while they seem like they should mean something, they don't. Like 'cablin' for 'cabin,' say."<br>I see what she means.<br>"I like that word," I tell her. "Cablin. Maybe I should appropriate it and give it a meaning."<br>Saskia gives a slow nod. "You see? That's how we're like ghost words. People can appropriate us and give us meanings, too."<br>I know she's talking about our anomalous origins--how because of them, we could be victim to that sort of thing--but I don't agree.<br>"That happens to everybody," I tell her. "It happens whenever someone decides what someone is like instead of finding out for real."<br>"I suppose."<br>"You're thinking about all of this too much."<br>"I can't seem to stop thinking about it."<br>I study her for a long moment. It's worrying her, this whole idea of what's real and what isn't, like how you came into this world is more important than what you do once you're here.<br>"What's the first thing you remember?" I ask.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2003 by Charles de Lint</p><h2>Wild at Heart and Captivating : Two Groundbreaking Books in One Volume</h2><p>The husband and wife have written the two novels but published in one volume.

WELLS AWARD <br><br>"The Editors Recommend" -&nbsp;<i>Scientific American</i>&nbsp;<br>What if you could be smarter, stronger, and have a better memory just by taking a pill?&nbsp;<br>What if we could alter our genes to cure Alzheimer's and Parkinson's?<br>What if we could halt or even reverse the human aging process?<br>What if we could communicate with each other&nbsp;<i>simply by thinking about it</i>?<br><br>These questions were once the stuff of science fiction. Today, advances in biotechnology have shown that they're plausible, even likely to be accomplished in the near future. In labs around the world, researchers looking for ways to help the sick and injured have stumbled onto techniques that enhance healthy animals--making them stronger, faster, smarter, and longer-lived--in some cases, even connecting their minds to robots and computers across the Internet.&nbsp;<br>Now science is on the verge of applying this knowledge to healthy men and women, allowing us to alter humanity in ways we'd previously only dreamed possible. The same research that could cure Alzheimer's is leading to drugs and genetic techniques that could boost human intelligence. The techniques being developed to stave off heart disease and cancer have the potential to slow or even reverse human aging. And brain implants that restore motion to the paralyzed and sight to the blind are already allowing a small set of patients to control robots and computers simply by thinking about it.<br><br>Not everyone welcomes this scientific progress. Cries of "against nature" arise from skeptics even as scientists break new ground at an astounding pace. Across the political spectrum, the debate roils: Should we embrace the power to alter our minds and bodies, or should we restrict it?&nbsp;<br><br>Distilling the most radical accomplishments being made in labs worldwide, including gene therapy, genetic engineering, stem cell research, life extension, brain-computer interfaces, and cloning,&nbsp;<i>More Than Human</i>&nbsp;offers an exciting tour of the impact biotechnology will have on our lives.

I pooh-pooh'ed the idea. The brain and body are much too complex to manipulate in that way, or so I thought.<br>That same year a scientist named Phil Kennedy in Atlanta implanted an electrode into the brain of a paralyzed patient named Johnny Ray - a stroke victim who was completely unable to move, speak, or feed himself. The electrode monitored the activity of just a few neurons inside the patients brain. But through it Johnny was able to learn to control a computer - moving a cursor around on a screen and typing out messages.<br>Later that year, Joe Tsien at Princeton made the cover of Time Magazine with his Doogie mice - genetically engineered mice that could learn at astounding speeds, up to five times as fast as genetically normal mice.<br>And that year is also when I learned of the pioneering longevity research of scientists like Tom Johnston at Colorado, who had genetically altered nematode worms to more than double their lifespan and preserve youthful health into old age.<br>Suddenly, it seemed, science was resembling science fiction.<br>At the same time, there are a number of voices raised in concern over these technologies. What does it mean to extend our lives, boost our mental abilities, or integrate our minds with computers? Would we still be human? What would happen to society? To equality? To the meaning of life?<br>I wrote this book to cover these two, interrelated topics:<br>1)The science of human enhancement - what's actually happening in the labs and what that could lead to in the near future.<br>2)The ethics, social consequences, and policy challenges of human enhancement. Basically, what we should or shouldn't do with this technology.<br>More Than Human is an optimistic book, but it's a cautious optimism. Along the way it looks at issues like the effect of longer lives on overpopulation, on socio-economic stratification and whether these technologies would help the rich pull further away from the poor, and at issues like human identity, and whether we could even call ourselves human after changing ourselves in such ways.<br>It's not a utopian book. There can be no doubt that using biotechnology to alter the human mind, body, and lifespan will lead to problems. But the conclusion I come to in the book is that these technologies will solve more problems than they create. And that the alternative - to prohibit their use - will create many more problems than it will solve."Ramez Naam provides a reliable and informed cook's tour of the world we might choose if we decide that we should fast-forward evolution.

He just never imagined that it would happen to him. After his profanity-laced tirade is caught on camera, his reputation and career are destroyed, leaving him without a script for the first time in years.<br><br>While American viewers may have loved and trusted Ted for decades, his family certainly didn't: His years of constant travel and his big-screen persona have frayed all of his important relationships. At the time of his meltdown, Ted is estranged from his wife, Claire, and his adult daughter, Franny, a writer for a popular website. Franny views her father's disgrace with curiosity and perhaps a bit of smug satisfaction, but when her boss suggests that she confront Ted in an interview, she has to decide whether to use his loss as her career gain. And for Ted, this may be a chance to take a hard look at what got him to this place, and to try to find his way back before it's too late. <br><br><i>Talk to Me</i> is a sharply observed, darkly funny, and ultimately warm story about a man who wakes up too late to the mess he's made of his life... and about our capacity for forgiveness and empathy.</p><p><b>John Kenney </b>is the author of <i>Truth in Advertising</i>, which won the Thurber Prize for American Humor in 2014.

Now he was falling at 120 miles per hour and the feeling was an odd combination of terror and relief. The speed of the fall when he exited the plane took his breath away. His goggles sucked to his face; his eyes felt as if they were being pulled back into his head, the pressure tremendous. Ted fell and he fell and he fell and he felt that he would never stop falling. It had been exactly two point five seconds so far.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a Sunday. He knew that. A Sunday in mid-April. Or was it late April? He wasn't sure. Strange to not know the date. It was late morning. He was fairly sure of that. The small plane had climbed from the airfield on eastern Long Island into clear blue skies. As the plane banked left, Ted could see the ocean below. He sat in his jumpsuit, in the cramped quarters of the plane, Raymond next to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had been cold on the plane. Colder still when Raymond slid the door open. The sound of the wind. The momentary panic-fear of what he was about to do. So Raymond had given him a little nudge. Fine. He'd pushed him, full on. He'd had to do that a fair amount in this job. People got excited and brave on the ground. Quite another thing to stare down from ten thousand feet with nothing between you and God's green earth but the thin silk on your back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ted fell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He thought he might throw up. He thought he might pass out. He thought he might already be dead. It was happening so fast. He lay flat on his belly, just as they'd practiced, Ted and Raymond, arms out, staring straight down. How he'd arrived in this position he wasn't sure. He raised his head and saw Raymond, smiling, two fat thumbs up, just another day at the office, as if they were sitting across from each other at a Starbucks enjoying Pumpkin Spice Lattes. Raymond, still smiling, tapped his oversized outdoorsman watch. It was time. Indeed, it was, thought Ted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raymond, the former army sergeant, who said he hadn't been planning on going up today. Raymond, who at first didn't recognize Ted. Raymond, who had to call in his pilot, Alvin, from out in Greenport. Raymond wore a GoPro camera on his helmet. Filmed the whole thing. "Hell, we even send you a little movie of it," he told Ted. "Email it to you before you're back in Manhattan."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The three of them had boarded the small plane, a 1982 Cessna T303 Crusader, according to Raymond. Miracle it still flew, he said, cackling, as Alvin pulled the stick back and launched them up over the airstrip, banked left, out over the ocean, the empty beaches of eastern Long Island, climbing, higher, the noise of the engine drowning out Raymond's incessant talking, Ted seeing the ocean, a distant boat, and remembering Franny's words from the story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raymond held up three beefy fingers and pointed to them with his other hand, the agreed-upon sign. He folded one down. Two fingers now. Time slowed down for Ted. It was taking an eternity. Raymond folded another down. One finger. They�d gone over this on the ground, again and again. �I like repeat customers,� Raymond had said. �That�s why we wear two chutes. Both chutes fail, well, the good Lord has other plans for you . . .�</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what else went through Ted's mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Screw Ted Grayson. This speck of a man falling from the sky. The world had handed him a microphone and asked him to tell them a story. Engage me, they'd said. Inform me. Thrill me. Enlighten me. And what had he done? Bored them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also the time he tailgated a person because of a bad mood, because he was in a rush. Honking, flashing his lights, jumping out of his car at the stoplight and pulling from the backseat a wood-handled Bancroft tennis racket, waving it like John McEnroe, only to find an eighty-year-old handicapped woman at the wheel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the time a diminutive homeless man reached out to touch him as he stepped out of a limousine, Ted surprised and frightened by the man, a contorted face shouting, "Fuck off, bum!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the time-fine, times-he'd been unfaithful to Claire. The years of distance, of ignoring her, of assuming she'd always be there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the time, recently, after the incident, he'd ignored the pleas of the network's lawyers and PR department and left the house, only to find a photo of himself on the cover of the following day's New York Post, disheveled, unshaven, having forgotten to zip his fly all the way up yet again, making what appeared to be a Nazi salute, when, in fact, it was simply a harmless attempt to hail a cab and escape the paparazzi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly, he thought of Franny. And the words she had used in the story. The world would see that she was lost to him. He couldn't reach her. His own daughter. He couldn't protect her now. And if you can't protect your child, what's the point of protecting yourself?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He went back to the hundreds of other images. Tiny, searing film clips that ran through his mind as he watched himself fall to Earth. The amount of callous, unthinking, uncaring asininity he'd committed in his life. The waste. A few years ago, a friend of Claire's died. A good man, a family man, a volunteer and coach. Kids weeping uncontrollably at the funeral. Overflowing church. Unfair, people said. But for Ted, who would show? No one would utter the word "unfair." They would wonder if they'd hit traffic after the service and what to make for dinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decision was not spontaneous, he realized. It had been there all day. It had been there for weeks, in fact, during the whole nightmare. Now, falling, the image of it all so clear. Here was the answer to all that had happened. Ted had no intention of opening his chute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was tired of the shame. Tired of the deep sadness for the loss of his life. Of everything that had once seemed to make sense and now didn't. He was tired of being afraid of what would happen next, of what other public embarrassment would come his way. He had lost something vital to the living process that he was unable to name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He heard the lead-in in his head. Ted Grayson, the longtime anchor of the evening news, died today in an embarrassing skydiving accident on eastern Long Island. Sources say the disgraced former newsman may have taken his own life. He was fifty-nine. (brief pause) When we come back: peanuts. Are they the new superfood?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No fingers now. Raymond made the motion to pull the chute. Raymond nodded. Ted nodded. Except then Ted did the one thing Raymond told him never to do. He pulled his arms in, aimed his head down, and suddenly he was Superman, heading toward the surface of the earth so fast he couldn't take it in. He had no control over his body so he began to roll. "Roll" is the wrong word. It was, instead, what Raymond had called a "death spin."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was falling, in thin air. This line echoed in a distant place in his mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He could no longer move his arms and legs. He was going to pass out in a matter of seconds. He did not feel at all well. The fear and regret, a primal scream inside that he needed to give voice to. But nothing came out. How perfect. How fitting, he thought. America's anchorman, in his dying moments, unable to make a sound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's all there, on the GoPro. Ted's life, on video. Looking into the camera, asking, what happens next? What's the story?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just keep watching.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We go live now to Ted Grayson in New York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two weeks earlier and Ted is in a mood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ninety seconds, Ted."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's Lou, in Ted's earpiece. Ted's executive producer, Lou Arno.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were in the middle of a two-and-a-half-minute commercial break, twenty-one minutes into the broadcast. One story left.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The Triangle package," Lou said. "Your lead-in, the prerecorded piece. You'll have eight seconds after the story. Think you can handle that, buddy? Don't worry, though, you'll have copy. Not that you need it. It's almost like a real job."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Something about this last bit annoyed Ted. It was something Lou had said before, in his harmless Lou voice. But there was an edge to it. Or was Ted's bad mood filter adding the edge? He wasn't sure. Either way, it further unsettled his already stormy insides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ted glared in the direction of the control room, then reached for his cell phone under the desk. He checked emails, texts. There was one from Claire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"In Bedford. Please stay in city. Might be best to speak through lawyers at this point. Also, happy birthday."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If that didn't say love, what did? Ted thought. Thirty years of marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a text from Polly, Ted's agent and attorney, asking if they were still on for dinner. Polly Klein (n&#x17d;e Paulette, a name she loathed) would meet him at Cafe Luxembourg at eight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Roger that?" Lou asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lou could see Ted from the control room, through the glass, as well as on the live feeds from the two cameras on set. He could also look up at a bank on ten monitors showing live feeds from some of the affiliates on the East Coast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Swell," Ted said. He was supposed to say "Roger Mudd." It was a thing he and Lou said. Roger Mudd was a newscaster years ago who did a famous interview with Senator Ted Kennedy, who had recently announced that he was running for president. Mudd asked Kennedy why he wanted to be president. Kennedy looked flummoxed, fumbled around for words. Some say it cost him the nomination against then president Jimmy Carter in 1980.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, for some reason, Ted didn't feel like saying it. The whole thing, the saying of it, annoyed and embarrassed him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's wrong, Teddy ballgame?" Lou pushed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ted turned to raise his middle finger to Lou but instead knocked over his water, soaking his script and a goodly portion of his pants. He heard Lou laughing, which only pissed him off more. A production assistant ran over with a roll of paper towels, dabbing the desk and then, awkwardly, Ted's wet lap. A sweet young kid name Greg. Or Larry. He wasn't sure. Overeager.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay, okay," Ted barked, regretting his tone immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The poor kid reacted like a scolded dog. "Sorry. And, um, happy birthday, Mister Grayson," he managed with a smile as he scampered off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, that's right," Lou said, fully aware that it was Ted's birthday. "Happy seventieth," he added, chuckling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lou was a difficult-to-determine fifty-nine, rail thin, an early morning runner, poor sleeper, bald since the age of twenty-four, crew cut on the sides and back. Khakis, a polo shirt tucked in, and running shoes every day. In the winter, a fleece vest. A fast blinker, eyes darting. He had a hard time relaxing. But then, that was his job. Grace under pressure. A constant state of ready for the unexpected. The late feed. The botched feed. The live report gone bad. The show that was running short and needed to be lengthened. The show that was running long and needed to be cut. The breaking news story halfway through a broadcast. The raw rush of live TV. Lou loved it. He had been with the broadcast three years, having replaced Ted's longtime producer Roy Wilson, who retired after his third heart attack. Lou had hoped that he and Ted might become close. To date it hadn't happened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lou looked at his own phone, which seemed to beep nonstop. Links and feeds and reporters in the field, updates, weather, police scanner, fire scanner, White House, State House, London Bureau, Jerusalem Bureau, Jo-Burg, Moscow, Hong Kong, Beijing. Lou checked his phone and then looked back up, watching Ted, who-Lou could feel it-was in a mood. Lou would remember this, weeks later, months later. And not just because Lou had a bizarre memory for details, numbers, chronology. In the endless retelling to the initially small internal review board, then later to the larger investigative committee (the goddamned East German Stasi, if Lou were honest about it), to friends, to colleagues, to a reporter for the New York Post, in a moment of candor he regretted and was partially misquoted on (to his eternal regret and shame), and mostly to Phyllis, his wife, who listened as Lou held a large scotch and stared off into the backyard, when it still seemed so unreal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ted would remember it, too, of course. Though he would remember it differently and always with the makeup woman. The replacement. Natalia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�The king is in a foul temper,� Murray said to no one in particular. He sniffed his fingertips, a thing he did that annoyed his two colleagues, one of his many tics. Scratching his head aggressively. Poking at his inner ears. Sniffing his fingers. The traits of a man who lived alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grace ignored him and continued typing. Jagdish looked up, smiled the kindly smile one might offer a child who'd just said, "Look, Dad! I put on my underpants all by myself." He then looked back at his computer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ted's news writing staff. Or what was left of it. They were in a small room a floor above the studio, a window overlooking Midtown. It was dark and the lights of the city were on. Murray loved the view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where once, twenty years ago, there were eight or nine of them, now it was this little band of brothers and one sister. And rumor had it that there were redundancies planned. A bank of flat-screens sat above one wall, each showing the major networks, along with CNN and Fox, all in commercial break before their final story. A smaller closed-circuit monitor showed a live feed from the newsroom and Ted's $11 million hair being tended to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grace said, "I'm making a change to the story."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Too late," Murray said, suddenly excited, in part because he loved when Grace did this, her last-minute changes that made a difference only to Grace, and also because she was speaking to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Tell Lou. I'm sending now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grace looked up at Murray and Murray picked up the phone. If Grace had said, "Hang from the outside ledge of the window naked," he would have done it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Murray picked up the phone and dialed. Lou picked up mid-ring.</p></p><h2>All-Consuming Fire (Doctor Who-The New Adventures)</h2><p>Landing in Victorian London, the TARDIS crew is surprised to meet up with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.</p><p></p><h2>Access Denied (A Turing Hopper Mystery)</h2><p>Tracking a fugitive&#39;s credit card purchases, Artificial Intelligence Personality Turing Hopper and her friends are lured to a vacant house--and what they discover could get them all &#34;deleted.&#34;</p><p>Donna Andrews introduced Turing Hopper in <i>You've Got Murder</i>, followed by <i>Click Here for Murder</i>. She also writes an award-winning birder's mystery series.Starred Review. Expert plotting and a highly original heroine lift Andrews's third entry in her Agatha Award&#x2013;winning series starring an almost-sentient computer (after 2003's <i>Click Here for Murder</i>). "Artificial Intelligence Personality" Turing Hopper has been monitoring the credit cards of notorious criminal-at-large Nestor Garcia, waiting for signs of activity. When suddenly thousands of dollars of purchases begin appearing, Turing traces them to deliveries to a vacant house in northern Virginia. For Garcia to be using his credit card in such a manner is highly suspicious, so Turing and "her" assistants, including human friends Tim and Maude, who work for Washington's Universal Library, start investigating. Tim watches the vacant house, but when a dead body turns up, Tim could well be the police's only real suspect in the murder. Later, someone tries to break into Maude's house, and Turing realizes that a devious plot is unfolding. Could Nestor Garcia be behind it all? As Turing works on the puzzle, racing against time, she observes everything with the wry, witty musings on human-computer relations that make this "techno-cozy" series a true standout. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

William Goldman describes it as a "good parts version" of "S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure." Morgenstern's original was filled with details of Florinese history, court etiquette, and Mrs. Morgenstern's mostly complimentary views of the text. Much admired by academics, the "Classic Tale" nonetheless obscured what Mr. Goldman feels is a story that has everything: "Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles." <p> Goldman frames the fairy tale with an "autobiographical" story: his father, who came from Florin, abridged the book as he read it to his son. Now, Goldman is publishing an abridged version, interspersed with comments on the parts he cut out. </p><p> Is <i>The Princess Bride</i> a critique of classics like <i>Ivanhoe</i> and <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, that smother a ripping yarn under elaborate prose? A wry look at the differences between fairy tales and real life? Simply a funny, frenetic adventure? No matter how you read it, you'll put it on your "keeper" shelf. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Believe it or not, my future husband used this book to win my hand. I think giving it to me as a gift was his way of proving that he is a hopeless romantic, since the book is so wonderfully hopelessly romantic. So far, he's lived up to it! If you've only seen the movie, but love it, then you should definitely read the book.

He is a former editor-at-large of <em>National Geographic</em> and has contributed dozens of articles, short stories, and poems to leading national magazines. His op-ed pieces and other essays have appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Washington Post</em>. For ten years he served under deep cover as a CIA operations officer.</p>Acclaimed for The Tears of Autumn, The Last Supper and other thrillers featuring master-spy Paul Christopher, McCarry now brings us a very different kind of novel set largely in early 18th century London and New England and featuring Christopher's ancestors. This is a remarkable narrative, written in McCarry's honed, imaginative style and packed with historical detail presented not as background but as lived experience. The central character is the enterprising Fanny, half-English, half-French, who, after various vicissitudes in London, accompanies her godfather, Oliver, when he goes to Connecticut to claim his inheritance. There she is abducted by Indians, taken to Canada and finally rescued by her French lover. The secondary characters, equally brimming with vigor and individuality, include savage Indians (scarcely more savage than the English and French for whom they fight); Oliver's beautiful, willful wife, who is in thrall to witchcraft; the Indianized daughter of an army captain; and a Puritan preacher-surgeon of surpassing toughness. Adroitly depicting passion, brutality, cultures in conflict and New World natural beauty, this novel is as engrossing as it is unusual. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>If Animals Could Talk</h2><p>If animals could talk, what would they say?

The book opens on Vermont EMT and single father Peter Webster&#39;s struggles with his teenage daughter Rowan&#39;s drinking and other self-destructive behavior. The story then flashes back to an earlier time and his rescue of Sheila, a woman under the influence who has caused a car accident. Sheila&#39;s wild spirit and Boston accent exert a pull on Peter, and the couple falls in love--and marries. Soon enough, things begin to fall apart as Sheila&#39;s alcoholism escalates, and a dramatic incident that threatens the infant Rowan&#39;s safety brings the marriage to an end. Holland vocalizes the simplest scenarios with compassion as he deftly captures Peter&#39;s gentle soul and Sheila&#39;s destructive compulsions.

Layer by layer, it grows and transforms. Its beauty starts to shine.<br><br>Exquisitely crafted by an award-winning author-illustrator team, this luminous, uplifting story reminds us of the amazing capacity for change within us all.<br></p><p>Donna Jo Napoli teaches linguistics at Swarthmore College and is the author of numerous books for young readers of all ages, including<i>Alligator Bayou</i>, an <i>ALA</i> Top Ten Book and winner of the Parents' Choice Gold Award;<i>The King of Mulberry Street</i>, a Sydney Taylor Award Honor book; and <i>Treasury of Greek Mythology</i>, an ALA Notable book.

He wrote and illustrated<em>The Raft</em>. He lives in Santa Cruz, California, where the ocean continually inspires his work.Based on a medieval Persian poem, this story of discovering self-worth is told through the emotional journey of a lowly grain of sand. It falls to the bottom of the sea, feeling alone and worthless and ends up in an oyster shell, where it becomes an irritant to its host. But when a diver discovers the oyster and the beautiful pearl inside, everything changes. The pearl is set in the necklace of a beloved daughter, bringing joy and laughter to her and the tiny grain of sand at the pearl&#x2019;s heart. The illustrations move from muted pastels of the sea to warm golden tones once the gem enters the world of humans. The acrylics and colored pencils give fluidity to each drawing; there are no hard edges here. Even as the grain of sand feels lost and alone, his world swirls with life and beauty. This is a thoughtful reminder that everything matters.

No missing pages or markings.</p><p>Turning their backs on modernism, the Boston-based painters covered in this artfully produced album prized a cult of beauty built on exacting craftsmanship and direct observation of nature. Notables included Joseph De Camp, who claimed that Whistler never mastered chiaroscuro; impressionist William Paxton; Edmund Tarbell, chronicler of leisure-class pursuits and New England scenery; Frederic Vinton, who went to Madrid to copy oils by Velasquez; and Frank Benson, known for his plein air landscapes. All but forgotten today, the Boston School artists deserve a better fate, argues Gammell, himself a painter of allegories as well as an erstwhile friend and colleague of these artists. As their self-appointed champion, Gammell, who died in 1981, makes overblown claims that tend to obscure the modest virtues that occasionally stand out despite the self-conscious realism. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Other Nineteenth Century</h2><p>A New Collection of Long Out-of-Print Stories From One of the Greatest Fantasists of the Twentieth Century<br><br>Avram Davidson, who died in 1993, was widely regarded as one of the most outstanding authors of short fantasy fiction in our time.

But, by common consent and by clerical permission, they now sounded something else entirely. The reddish-gray-haired man looked up from the sheet of parchment, of which he must by now, it seemed, know every letter, so often had he scanned it. Immersed though he was in his text and his thoughts, still he lifted his head at length and spoke.&#x201c;It sounds as though every church in the city is ringing its bells,&#x201d; he murmured.The friend and countryman who had so long and so often stood by his side, figuratively and literally, said, &#x201c;Yes, and even in the suburbs ... the Liberties, as they call them here.&#x201d;The reddish-gray-haired man made a soft, musing noise, turned again to the document, then half-raised his head once more. &#x201c;One might call them liberty bells, then,&#x201d; he said. Another thought brought his head all the way up. &#x201c;What was it,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;that text from Scripture&#x2014;you recall, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2014;on the bell in Philadelphia?&#x201d;His friend and countryman considered, nodded. &#x201c;&#x2018;Proclaim liberty throughout the land&#x2014;&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye, liberty. The Jews had a word for it. And &#x2018;unto all the inhabitants thereof,&#x2019; aye ... .&#x201d; He nodded, sighed. &#x201c;Philadelphia,&#x201d; he said.&#x201c;Williamsburg.&#x201d;Richmond.&#x201d;&#x201c;The Chickahominy.&#x201d;&#x201c;The Rapahannock.&#x201d;At the door, a burly, tousle-headed fellow, cheeks stubby and shirt (none too fresh) open at his shaggy breast, looked in, listened. His face showed a mixture of impatience and compassion. Often had he listened to these and other refugees recounting, as a litany, the names of their towns and provinces. (One could not always tell them apart.) Sometimes the names of the New World (perhaps Brave, perhaps just Bold) merely echoed the names of the Old. (O servant exalted above the master!) Sometimes they seemed a concatenation of barbarous sybilants and gutterals from the aboriginal tongues. Ah, well. To duty.&#x201c;Are you quite ready for us, then?&#x201d; he asked the two. They turned.&#x201c;Ah, Charles. I should think&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah, Charles. Just one more moment. A last look. You understand.&#x201d;&#x201c;Of course. Of course. No wish to rush you.&#x201d; He coughed; he raised his eyebrows. The reddish-gray-haired man went back to his text. The friend moved quietly and, gently and tactfully (he was not always quiet, or gentle, or tactful) eased the newcomer away.&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t be much longer at it, I promise. I know.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, yes. You&#x2019;ve known him a long time.&#x201d;&#x201c;Since his hair was quite red.&#x201d;Arm in arm they moved out into the corridor. There, all was controlled turmoil. Country squires and yeoman farmers with mud on their boots spoke confidentially to craftsmen smelling of machine oil and the forge. Bishops, white sleeved, listened with modified majesty to inferior clergy, all in black save for the white bands at the neck. And a member of the old peerage, head covered with a wig of archaic cut, nodded to the comments of an old man wrapped in a ragged&#x2014;and still, technically, illegal&#x2014;tartan. It was at least as likely that this last anachronism had crossed, recently and hastily, from long exile in France, than that he had descended from Scotland. The Estates, as the Scottish parliament was called since the revisions of the Act of Union, had done little more with the use of their regained powers than to pass innumerable acts of outlawry and attainder upon each other. But this, too, would soon enough pass away.Very, very soon, in fact.On seeing the two approach, one gentleman, evidently in a condition of total confusion as well as in court dress (court dress, sword and all), buttonholed the burly fellow with an agitated air.&#x201c;Where will it end, Charles?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Where will it all end?&#x201d;&#x201c;All&#x2019;s well that ends well,&#x201d; was the half-muttered reply, then added, after a moment&#x2019;s recollection, &#x201c;Doctor.&#x201d;As though needing no more than this acknowledgment of his profession, the doctor at once said, &#x201c;As to where it all began, why, say I, it all began with the fatal tennis ball. Or, if I may be permitted to say it&#x2014;&#x201d; here he glanced around, defiantly &#x201c;&#x2014;the insufficiently fatal tennis ball.&#x201d;&#x201c;Water under the bridge,&#x201d; Charles muttered, tugged a watch out, glanced, then muttered again, &#x201c;Water under the bridge ... . London Bridge ... .&#x201d;But the medical man&#x2019;s phrase was overheard, was appreciated, was at once repeated and passed from mouth to mouth. &#x201c;<i>The insufficiently fatal tennis ball ... .&#x201d;</i>And the bells rang out and the bells rang on. St. Paul&#x2019;s, St. Martin&#x2019;s, St. Clemens, Bow, St. Mary-le-Bone ... .<i>&#x201c;The insufficiently fatal tennis ball ... .&#x201d;</i><br><br>The Stuarts, as even the handful of still-unreconstructed Jacobites would needs admit, the Stuarts had their faults. But they had not hated their heirs. That is, the Jameses and the Charleses had not hated one another. Anne, to be sure, now, Anne&#x2014;Anne had certainly shown no fondness for, first, Sophia, Dowager Electress of Hanover, and for Sophia&#x2019;s son, George. But they were only Anne&#x2019;s distant cousins, and were far off in what someone later was to term &#x201c;a despicable Electorate.&#x201d; Poor Anne! Last of the Stuarts actually to occupy the throne, thirteen (thirteen!) pregnancies, and no heir to outlive her, she might have been (and was) excused for not wishing the sight or presence of her so-distant kin.But it was left for the kin themselves to exemplify the phrase of Elizabeth, her sentiment that &#x201c;she could not bear to hear the mention of a Successor.&#x201d; And yet, even so, Elizabeth, too, had had some reason. Had she not? &#x201c;The Queen of Scots hath a bonny Babe, and I am but a barren stock.&#x201d; Thus Elizabeth. But what reason had the sovereigns of the House of Hanover for hating, and for so hating, their own heirs? Heirs who were of their own bodies lawfully begotten&#x2014;and lawfully present. Had not George I, at a court levee, publicly cursed his son, the future George II, forbidding him thenceforth to attend cabinet meetings, cabinet meetings from which, there no longer being any interpreter whom German George felt he could trust, the king thenceforth absented himself from. (And a good thing, too, said many.)Even this, however, had faded beside the subsequent hatred of George II for his own heir, Frederick, Prince of Wales. The English, not used to the sort of thing which was evidently traditional in Hanover, the English had murmured, &#x201c;Poor Fred ... .&#x201d; Poor Fred, indeed. The king could not, after all, immure the Prince of Wales in a palace prison, however much he called him &#x201c;scoundrel.&#x201d; Nor could he cut his son off from revenues which either had been voted as &#x201c;supply&#x201d; by Act of Parliament, or accrued by ancient English law and custom, via the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster. However much he thought and called him &#x201c;fool.&#x201d;Frederick, Prince of Wales, was, however, subject to all the coldness, the scorn, hatred, spleen and exclusion of which his father, George II, was capable. He was left to molder in his own petty counter-court, attended only by those politicians who were not merely out of favor but entertained no hopes of ever being again in favor while George lived. The prince was left to admire the poems of Pope. And he was left to play tennis.It was the blow upon or near the breastbone, the blow from a hard-struck tennis ball, which gave the princely physician a concern. &#x201c;I fear me,&#x201d; the meddlesome apothecary had murmured, &#x201c;I fear me that this blow might be the occasion of an imposthume. And that, should Your Royal Highness suffer at some future date from a severe cold ... an inflammation on the lungs ... .&#x201d;&#x201c;Is nothing to be done?&#x201d; inquired the prince, somewhat languid from opium and ipecac. &#x201c;Am I so soon to leave nine orphans? [There had been, after all, one other thing in which the king was powerless to constrain him.] Should we send for the chaplain?&#x201d; But the physician-in-ordinary was not ready to send for the chaplain.&#x201c;I should propose to bleed Your Royal Highness once again,&#x201d; he said. The Prince of Wales, however, was not ready to be bled once again. &#x201c;Then I should propose to purge Your Royal Highness once again.&#x201d; But the prince absolutely refused to be purged once again.The physician-in-ordinary threw up his hands. &#x201c;In that case,&#x201d; he said. And stopped. &#x201c;In that case ... . In that case, I must recommend ... in fact ... . In that case,&#x201d; he said, firmly, &#x201c;I indeed must insist upon Your Royal Highness taking a long and immediate change of air.&#x201d;As was to be expected, the king managed to contain his grief.&#x201c;A change of air? Vhere?&#x201d; he demanded.&#x201c;The Isle of Wight has been suggested, Your Majesty.&#x201d;&#x201c;Der Isle of <i>Vhat?&#x201d;</i> A map was brought and the Isle of Wight pointed out to the king, who was pleased to give a grunt, interpreted as a Gracious Assent.However and however.&#x201c;His Royal Highness does not, it seems, desire to go to the Isle of Wight.&#x201d;The king had been playing backgammon with his mistress and already felt bored with this interfering subject.<i>&#x201c;Teufelsdreck!</i> Dhen vhere he vants to go?&#x201d; It was intimated that the prince had expressed a preference for either Hanover or France as the scene of his recuperation. The king gave a shout of rage and kicked the backgammon board across the room. Hanover? Never! Hanover ... . In Hanover ... . In Hanover the air was sweeter, the water purer, the food better, the populace more loyal (&#x201c;&#x2014;than in England&#x201d; being understood). Hanover was reserved for the king himself to go to for changes of air. And as for <i>France&#x2014;</i>&#x201c;He vould intrigue vhit der French king! He vould efen intrigue vhit der pretender!&#x201d; It was pointed out to him that the pretender now lived in Italy, and rather meanly, on a papal pension. But the king would hear no arguments. Once let Frederick set foot upon the Continent, why, what would prevent his going even to Italy? <i>&#x201c;Der force of graffity, maybe?&#x201d;</i> he screamed, with immense sarcasm.<i>&#x201c;Nein! Nein! He can go to der Isle of Vight&#x2014;or he can go to Hell</i>&#x2014;<i>und</i>&#x2014;<i>und</i>&#x2014;<i>if he doesn&#x2019;t vant to go to Hell, den he can go to America!</i>&#x201d;At this, the royal mistress was unwise enough to allow a snort of laughter to escape her lips. The entire court waited breathlessly for the lightnings. But the king, having had his attention called to the fact of his having made a joke, abruptly decided to enjoy it. His hard-bitten little red face grew redder still, and the court, breathing inward sighs of relief, joined in the now royally permissible laughter.And on this merry gale, the prince&#x2019;s vessel was wafted out to sea.<br><br>First aboard the <i>Anna Maria</i> was the royal and proprietarial governor. His cocked hat showing above the railing as he climbed the ladder, he was demanding, &#x201c;Have ye got me snuff with ye? Have ye got me madeira? Have ye brought me mail, me newsletters?&#x201d; With a heave and a ho he clambered on deck, looked all around. &#x201c;Have ye got any pretty wenches that have come to seek their fortunes in the new-found world? Have ye&#x2014;&#x201d; And here his face, which had just that moment focused on a slender and somewhat pale passenger, underwent an absolutely fascinating transformation.<i>&#x201c;Your Royal Highness!&#x201d;</i> he bawled, and did not so much fall upon his knees as on his face.It was in this manner that Frederick, Prince of Wales, came to America.The king, it was reported, had near had an apoplexy when he heard the news. But he had, after all, he <i>had</i> given his permission. After a fashion, no doubt, but given it he had. And in the hearing of all the court. There was, then, nothing he could do about it.From <i>The Court Circular and Gazette:</i> <br><i>His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, and their Children [here followed a list], have, by Reason of His Majesty&#x2019;s Most Gracious Solicitude, engaged upon a visit to the American Plantations, in order that His Royal Highness may recruit his Health.</i><br>No member of the royal family had ever before set foot upon the soil of the American plantations (&#x201c;the colonies,&#x201d; as it was now becoming fashionable to call them). And, suddenly, in one stroke, here were eleven of them! They moved into the home of the royal and proprietarial governor, the r. and p.g. moved into the house of the lieutenant-governor and the lieutenant-governor moved into an inn. The governor&#x2019;s home was, for the Americas, palatial. But it was, after all, crowded with all of them there. It was <i>damned</i> crowded!&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s build a little house,&#x201d; the prince suggested. &#x201c;Eh, my dearest? Shall we build a little house along the river? Is that not a capital suggestion?&#x201d; The princess thought that it <i>was</i> a capital suggestion. All her life, after all, she had lived in houses built for others. The notion that she might now have a voice in designing one for her own use fell upon her ears like harpsichord music played by an orchestra of angels. The house was to be on the Delaware River, and not on the Thames? Bless you, it might have been on the Styx for all she cared! And in the meanwhile ... in the meanwhile ... for it <i>was</i> crowded in the governor&#x2019;s house ... well, what about a visitation of the <i>other</i> colonies?And so it was arranged. The youngermost ones of the royal infants remained in Pennsylvania with their nurses; the eldest of the royal infants accompanied their royal parents. New Jersey and New York had heard with curiosity what they now beheld with enthusiasm. Connecticut had been cool, but the coolness was now warmed. Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Providence plantations had, in fact, been skeptical about the whole thing: who knew but that it was some sort of a flummery tale concocted down there in Pennsylvany? What would a prince be doing in America, anyway? It was all obviously, or half-obviously, a sort of granny&#x2019;s tale. Prince? There was no&#x2014;And then, thunderation! <i>Here he was</i>!And would you just look-see what he was <i>doing</i>!Previous examples of British officialdom had merely sniffed at the coarse foodstuffs of the frontier, hastily ordered their cooks to prepare some French kickshaws (&#x201c;Or at least a decent dish of mutton!&#x201d;). Not Fred. The capacity of Frederick for the New England dinner, boiled or otherwise, was prodigious.<i>&#x201c;Look</i> at him a-tuckin&#x2019; inta the baked beans!&#x201d;&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t do a injustice to the hasty puddin&#x2019;, either!&#x201d;<i>&#x201c;How</i> many bowls o&#x2019; chowder and <i>how</i> many quohogs&#x2019;d the prince eat down&#x2019;t the clambake?&#x201d;Up came the First Selectman of the Township of East Neantic, which was, so to speak, catering the affair; sweating and smiling slightly (in East Neantic they smile slightly where others would beam), he called his order for &#x201c;more o&#x2018;th&#x2019; ha&#x2018;nch o&#x2019;venison fr His R&#x2019;yal Highness!&#x201d;And, not very long later: &#x201c;More roast beef fr the Prince o&#x2019; Wales!&#x201d;In England, venison came from the King&#x2019;s Deer, and the king was not inclined to share. In England, one had not known that bears could be roasted; in England, one had, in fact, never even seen a bear!The New Englanders looked at each other, looked at their prince&#x2014;who gave them back a hearty grin, somewhat greasy about the chops&#x2014;looked at each other again.&#x201c;Likes our vittles, do he?

We inhabit a wasteland of ignorance when it comes to essential human values. <p>But precisely it is the very darkness of this spiritual void which draws down an adequate response to the situation, for "nature abhors a vacuum." The world may pass by blindly, but the Truth has nevertheless struck home for those who have eyes to see, in the vast witness over the past some fifty years given in the works of Frithjof Schuon. Schuon casts a light on mankind's ancient heritages and transmitted wisdom through his impressive and precise handling of complextheological and metaphysical problems. His genius lies in the way he applies universal principles to the relevant domains of metphysics, theology, cosmology, anthropology, and the arts and cultures of our world in general. To read and understand this book is to gain an ordered world view for our times, and for all times, for the message is integral, universal, and pertinent to both our present lifeand final ends. </p><p>Now required reading at The College of New Jeresey</p></p><p>Frithjof Schuon is best known as the foremost spokesman of the religio perennis and as a philosopher in the metaphysical current of Shankara and Plato. Over the past 50 years, he has written more than 20 books on metaphysical, spiritual and ethnic themes as well as having been a regular contributor to journals on comparative religion in both Europe and America. Schuon's writings have been consistently featured and reviewed in a wide range of scholarly and philosophical publications around the world, respected by both scholars and spiritual authorities. <p>Schuon was born in 1907 in Basle, Switzerland, of German parents. As a youth, he went to Paris, where he studied for a few years before undertaking a number of trips to North Africa, the Near East and India in order to contact spiritual authorities and witness traditional cultures. Following World War II, he accepted an invitation to travel to the American West, where he lived for several months among the Plains Indians, in whom he has always had a deep interest. Having received his education in France, Schuon has written all his major works in French, which began to appear in English translation in 1953. Of his first book, The Transcendent Unity of Religions (London, Faber &amp; Faber) T.S. Eliot wrote: "I have met with no more impressive work in the comparative study of Oriental and Occidental religion." </p><p>The traditionalist or "perennialist" perspective began to be enunciated in the West at the beginning of the twentieth century by the French philosopher Rene Guenon and by the Orientalist and Harvard professor Ananda Coomaraswamy. Fundamentally, this doctrine is the Sanatana Dharma--the "eternal religion"--of Hindu Vedantists. It was formulated in the West, in particular, by Plato, by Meister Eckhart in the Christian world, and is also to be found in Islam with Sufism. Every religion has, besides its literal meaning, an esoteric dimension, which is essential, primordial and universal. This intellectual universality is one of the hallmarks of Schuon's works, and it gives rise to many fascinating insights into not only the various spiritual traditions, but also history, science and art. </p><p>The dominant theme or principle of Schuon's writings was foreshadowed in his early encounter with a Black marabout who had accompanied some members of his Senegalese village to Switzerland in order to demonstrate their culture. When the young Schuon talked with him, the venerable old man drew a circle with radii on the ground and explained: "God is in the center, all paths lead to Him."</p>"Any serious person will feel grateful to be confronted by such a generously discerning intellect ... in this darkening time." -- <i>Jacob Needleman, San Francisco State University</i><br><br>"Intellectually rigorous in the highest degree ... There is no other voice like that of Schuon." -- <i>Arthur Versluis, Michigan State University, editor of Esoterica, an on-line journal</i><br><br>"Schuon is unsurpassed--and I would add unequalled--as a writer on comparative religion." -- <i>Martin Lings, author of A Sufi Saint of the Twentieth Century, and What is Sufism?</i><br><br>"Schuon possesses the gift of reaching the very core of the subject he is treating, of going beyond forms." -- <i>Seyyed Hossein Nasr, George Washington University</i><br><br>"The man is a living wonder ... I know of no living writer who begins to rival him." -- <i>Huston Smith, University of California, Berkeley</i></p><h2>Jazz Guitar Chord Voicings</h2><p>(Guitar Educational).

Her back was complaining, but that was only normal after an evening&#x2019;s work cleaning. The cleaning was certainly necessary. The pupils at Prince Mordred&#x2019;s Private Academy for Boys managed to get just as much mud and muck on the floor as any other teenagers would. Clean indoor studies in the dark arts, military history, and alchemy didn&#x2019;t preclude messy outdoor classes in strategic combat, duelling, open-field assassination, and rugby.</p><p>The clock in the study struck the quarter hour. That gave her forty-five minutes before the midnight orisons and chants. She knew from weeks of experience&#x2014;and, to be honest, her own memories of boarding-school&#x2014;that the boys wouldn&#x2019;t be getting up a moment earlier than necessary. This meant most would be dragging themselves out of bed at eleven forty-five before heading to the chapel with hastily thrown-on clothes and barely brushed hair. So that gave her thirty minutes before any of them started moving.</p><p>Thirty minutes to steal a book and to escape.</p><p>She propped the mop in her bucket, straightened, and took a moment to rub her knuckles into the small of her back. Sometimes undercover work as a Librarian involved posing as a rich socialite, and the Librarian in question got to stay at expensive hotels and country houses. All while wearing appropriately high fashion and dining off haute cuisine, probably on gold-edged plates. At other times, it involved spending months building an identity as a hard�working menial, sleeping in attics, wearing a plain grey woollen dress, and eating the same food as the boys. She could only hope that her next assignment wouldn&#x2019;t involve endless porridge for breakfast.</p><p>Two doors down along the corridor was Irene&#x2019;s destination: the House Trophy Room. It was full of silver cups, all engraved with variations on Turquine House, as well as trophy pieces of art and presentation manuscripts.</p><p>One of those manuscripts was her goal.</p><p>Irene had been sent by the Library to this alternate world to obtain Midnight Requiems, the famous necromancer Balan Pestifer&#x2019;s first published book. It was by all accounts a fascinating, deeply informative, and highly unread piece of writing. She&#x2019;d spent a month looking for a copy of it, as the Library didn&#x2019;t actually require an original version of the text, just an accurate one. Unfortunately, not only had she been unable to track down a copy, but her enquiries had caught the interest of other people (necromancers, bibliophiles, and ghouls). She&#x2019;d had to burn that cover identity and go on the run before they caught up with her.</p><p>It had been pure chance (or, as she liked to think of it, finely honed instinct) that had prompted her to notice a casual reference in some correspondence to &#x201c;Sire Pestifer&#x2019;s fond memories of his old school&#x201d; and, more, &#x201c;his donations to the school.&#x201d; Now, at the time that Pestifer had written this early piece, he&#x2019;d still been young and unrecognized. It was not beyond the bounds of possibility that in his desperation for attention, or simply out of the urge to brag, he&#x2019;d donated a copy of his writings to the school. (And she&#x2019;d exhausted all her other leads. It was worth a try.)</p><p>Irene had taken a few weeks to establish a new identity as a young woman in her mid-twenties with a poor but honest background, suitable for skivvying, then found herself a job as a cleaning maid. The main school library hadn&#x2019;t held any copies of Midnight Requiems, and in desperation she&#x2019;d resorted to checking the necromancer&#x2019;s original boarding-house. Beyond all expectation, she&#x2019;d been lucky.</p><p>She abandoned her cleaning equipment and opened the window at the end of the hall. The leaded glass swung easily under her hand: she&#x2019;d taken care to oil it earlier. A cool breeze drifted in, with a hint of oncoming rain. Hopefully this bit of misdirection wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary, but one of the Library&#x2019;s mottos was borrowed directly from the great military thinker Clausewitz: no strategy ever survived contact with the enemy. Or, in the vernacular, Things Will Go Wrong. Be Prepared.</p><p>She quickly trotted back down the corridor to the trophy room and pushed the door open. The light from the corridor gleamed on the silver cups and glass display cabinets. Without bothering to kindle the room&#x2019;s central lantern, she crossed to the second cupboard on the right. She could still smell the polish she&#x2019;d used on the wood two days before. Opening its door, she withdrew the pile of books stacked at the back and pulled out a battered volume in dark purple leather.</p><p>(When Pestifer sent the book to the school, had he fretted and paced the floor, hoping to get some sort of acknowledgement back from the teachers, praising his research, wishing him future success? Or had they sent him a bare form letter to say that they&#x2019;d received it and then dropped his work into a pile of other self-published vanity books sent by ex-pupils and forgotten all about it?)</p><p>Fortunately it was a fairly small volume. She tucked it into a hidden pocket, returned the other books to cover her tracks, and then hesitated.</p><p>This was, after all, a school that taught magic. And as a Librarian she had one big advantage that nobody else had&#x2014;not necromancers, Fae, dragons, ordinary humans, or anyone. It was called the Language. Only Librarians could read it. Only Librarians could use it. It could affect certain aspects of reality. It was extremely useful, even if the vocabulary needed constant revision. Unfortunately, it didn&#x2019;t work on pure magic. If the masters at the school had set some sort of alarm spell to prevent anyone from stealing the cups, and if that worked on anything that was taken out of the room, then she might be in for a nasty surprise. And it would be hideously embarrassing to be hunted down by a mob of teenagers.</p><p>Irene mentally shook herself. She&#x2019;d planned for this. There was no point in delaying any longer, and standing around reconsidering possibilities would only result in her running short on time.</p><p>She stepped across the threshold.</p><p>Sudden raucous noise broke the silence. The stone arch above the doorway rippled, lips forming from the stone to howl, &#x201c;Thief! Thief!&#x201d;</p><p>Irene didn&#x2019;t bother pausing to curse fate. There would be people here within seconds. With a loud scream, she threw herself down on top of her mop and bucket, deliberately sprawling in the inevitable puddle of dirty water. She also managed to crack her shin on the side of the bucket, which brought genuine tears to her eyes.</p><p>A couple of senior boys got there first, scurrying round the corner in nightshirts and slippers. Far too awake to have only just risen from sleep, they&#x2019;d probably been busy with some illicit hobby or other.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the thief?&#x201d; the dark-haired one shouted.</p><p>&#x201c;There she is!&#x201d; the blond one declared, pointing a finger at Irene.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be stupid&#x2014;that&#x2019;s one of the servants,&#x201d; the dark�haired one said, which demonstrated the advantage of stealing books while dressed as a servant. &#x201c;You! Wench! Where&#x2019;s the thief?&#x201d;</p><p>Irene pointed a shaking hand in the direction of the open window. It chose that moment to swing conveniently in the rising wind. &#x201c;He&#x2014;he knocked me down&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; One of the masters had arrived on the scene. Fully dressed and trailing a drift of tobacco smoke, he cleared a path through the gathering mob of junior boys with a few snaps of his fingers. &#x201c;Has one of you boys set off the alarm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir!&#x201d; the blond senior said quickly. &#x201c;We just got here as he was escaping. He went out through the window! Can we pursue him?&#x201d;</p><p>The master&#x2019;s gaze shifted to Irene. &#x201c;You, woman!&#x201d;</p><p>Irene hastily dragged herself to her feet, leaning artistically on the mop, and pushed back a straggle of loose hair. (She was looking forward to being out of this place so she could have hot showers and put her hair up in a proper bun.) &#x201c;Yes, sir?&#x201d; she snivelled. The book in her skirt pocket pressed against her leg.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you see?&#x201d; he demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sir,&#x201d; Irene began, letting her lower lip quiver suitably, &#x201c;I was just mopping the corridor, and when I came to the door of the trophy room here&#x201d;&#x2014;she pointed it out needlessly&#x2014;&#x201c;there was a light inside. So I thought that one of the young gentlemen might be studying&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I knocked on the door to ask if I might come in to clean the floor. But nobody answered, sir. So I began to open the door, and then all of a sudden someone pushes it open from inside, and it knocks me down as he runs out of the room.&#x201d;</p><p>The audience of boys, ranging from eleven to seventeen years old, hung on her every word. A couple of juniors set their chins pugnaciously, clearly imagining that they themselves would have been ready for such an event. They would undoubtedly have knocked the intruder unconscious then and there.</p><p>&#x201c;He was a very tall man,&#x201d; Irene said helpfully. &#x201c;And he was all dressed in black, but something was muffled round his face so that I couldn&#x2019;t see it properly. And he had something under one arm, all wrapped in canvas. And then the alarm went off and I screamed for help, but he went running down the corridor and escaped through the window.&#x201d; She pointed at the clearly open window, an obvious&#x2014;perhaps too obvious?&#x2014;escape route for any hypothetical thief.</p><p>&#x201c;And then these young gentlemen came along, just after he&#x2019;d escaped.&#x201d; She nodded to the first two arrivals, who looked smug.</p><p>The master nodded. He stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p><p>&#x201c;Morton! Palmwaite! Take charge of the House and have everyone get back to preparing for chapel. Salter, Bryce, come and inventory the room with me. We must establish what was taken.&#x201d;</p><p>There were muffled noises of protest from the milling crowd of boys, who clearly wanted to leap out the window and pursue the thief&#x2014;or, possibly, go down to the ground floor and then pursue the thief without leaping out of a second-floor window. But nobody actually tried that.</p><p>Irene cursed inwardly. A large-scale pursuit of a non-existent intruder would have confused matters nicely.</p><p>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; the master said, turning to Irene. &#x201c;Go downstairs to the kitchen and have some tea, woman. It must have been an unpleasant experience for you.&#x201d; Was that a flash of genuine concern in his eyes? Or was it something more suspicious? She&#x2019;d done her best to leave a false trail, but the fact remained that she was the only person in the vicinity, and something had just been stolen. Most of the masters round here ignored the servants, but this one might be the unfortunate exception to the rule. &#x201c;Hold yourself ready in case we need to question you further.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir,&#x201d; Irene said, bobbing a little curtsey. She picked up the mop and bucket and pushed through the crowd of boys, heading for the stairs, taking care not to walk suspiciously fast.</p><p>She&#x2019;d need two minutes to get to the kitchen to dump the mop and bucket. Another minute to get out of the House. Five more minutes&#x2014;three minutes at a run&#x2014;to get to the school library. She would be cutting it fine.</p><p>The kitchen was already bustling when she got there, with the house maids preparing kettles of post-chapel porridge. The housekeeper, butler, and cook were playing cards, and no one had bothered to investigate the alarms from upstairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Something the matter, Meredith?&#x201d; the housekeeper enquired as Irene entered.</p><p>&#x201c;Just the young gentlemen being their usual selves, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Irene answered. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s one of the other Houses playing some sort of prank on them. With your permission, may I step out to the washroom to get myself cleaned up?&#x201d; She indicated the dirty wash-water stains on her grey uniform dress and her apron.</p><p>&#x201c;Be sure not to take too long,&#x201d; the housekeeper said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be sweeping out the dormitories while the young gentlemen are in chapel.&#x201d;</p><p>Irene nodded humbly and left the kitchen. Still no outcry from upstairs. Good. She quietly opened the boarding-house door, stepping outside.</p><p>The boarding-houses were in a row along the main avenue, with a central quadrangle holding the chapel, the assembly hall, and&#x2014;most important to her purposes&#x2014;the school library. Turquine House was the second along, which meant there was just one house to pass, preferably without drawing attention. Not run. She mustn&#x2019;t run yet. If anyone saw her running, it would only attract suspicion. Just walk, nice and calmly, as if she were simply running an errand.</p><p>She managed a whole ten yards.</p><p>A window flew up behind her in Turquine House, and the master who&#x2019;d spoken to her earlier leaned out. He pointed at her. &#x201c;Thief! Thief!&#x201d;</p><p>Irene picked up her skirts and ran. Gravel crunched under her feet, and the first drops of rain slapped against her face. She came level with the next boarding-house, Bruce House, and for a moment she considered abandoning her arranged escape plan and simply ducking into there in order to break her trail and slow down pursuit. But common sense pointed out that it wouldn&#x2019;t work for more than a few minutes&#x2014;</p><p>The whistling screech from behind warned her just in time. She dived to the ground, throwing herself into a roll as the gargoyle came screaming down, its stone claws extended and clutching for her. It missed and struggled to pull out of its dive, its heavy wings sawing at the air as it laboured to gain height. Another one had swooped from the roof of Turquine&#x2019;s and was circling to reach a suitable angle of attack.</p><p>This was one of those moments, Irene reflected bitterly, when it would be wonderful to be a necromancer, or a wizard, or someone who could manipulate the magical forces of the world and blast annoying gargoyles out of the sky. She&#x2019;d done her best to avoid attention, keep her cover, and not endanger bratty little boys who left mud all over the floor and didn&#x2019;t bother to hang up their cloaks. What had it got her? A swarm of attacking gargoyles&#x2014;well, only two gargoyles so far, but still, and probably a mass assault by pupils and masters within a few minutes. So much for the rewards of virtue.</p><p>She quickly reviewed what she knew about the gargoyles. There was one on the roof of each boarding-house. They were even listed in the boarding-school prospectus as a guarantee of student safety&#x2014;any kidnappers will be torn to bloody rags by our professionally maintained historical artefacts! Though after working here for several months, she thought the pupils themselves were much more lethal to possible kidnappers.</p><p>On the positive side (one must always look for the positive side), the gargoyles were extremely showy but not actually that effective over a short space of ground. On the negative side, running in a straight line to escape would make her a beautiful moving target. But getting back to the positives, the gargoyles were made of granite, as lovingly described in the prospectus, unlike anything else within earshot.</p><p>This would need careful timing. Luckily the gargoyles weren&#x2019;t particularly intelligent, so they would be focused on capturing her, not on wondering why she was standing conveniently still.</p><p>She took a deep breath.</p><p>The ...</p></p><h2>Trickster&#39;s Choice (Trickster Series)</h2><p>Tamora Pierce brings readers another Tortall adventure! Alianne is the teenage daughter of the famed Alanna, the first lady knight in Tortall. Young Aly follows in the quieter footsteps of her father, however, delighting in the art of spying. When she is captured and sold as a slave to an exiled royal family in the faraway Copper Islands, it is this skill that makes a difference in a world filled with political intrigue, murderous conspiracy, and warring gods. This is the first of two books featuring Alianne.</p><p>To the great joy of her many fans, Tamora Pierce with this book begins a new saga of Tortall to add to The Song of the Lioness Quartet, the Immortals Quartet, and The Protector of the Small tetralogy. At the center of each of these books is always a strong and resourceful young woman who masters the arts of swordplay and knightly warfare in the magical medieval country of Tortall. Alianne, or Aly, daughter of the warrior queen Alanna the Lioness, has all these skills, but also a delicious sense of humor, which serves her well when she is chosen by the trickster god Kyprioth to serve as his secret agent and a slave for a year in the embattled Copper Isles. There the dark-skinned natives, or raka, have been conquered and crushed by the laurin, light-skinned people from the mainland. The burning raka resentment is fueled by prophecies of a twice royal queen who will free them, aided by the "wise one, the cunning one, the strong one, the warrior, and the crows." Just how each of the colorful characters and Aly herself fit into this prophecy and Kyprioth&#x2019;s tricky plan keeps readers guessing. Aly plots to show her skill at spying as she flirts with the god and is courted by Nawat, a crow transformed into a handsome young man, who is puzzled when she rejects his attempts to mate-feed her with grubs and ants. <p> The pages of this long but fast-paced adventure zip by, enlivened by intrigue, skirmishes, comedy, romance, and lots of dramatic clothes.

Life had been rotating around his illness for a number of months, and I was way behind on my household chores, including grocery shopping. Living on an island off the Texas coast, pickings are slim for a vegetarian palate. Every few months, I trek to the mainland for what my children call "Momma's weird food."</p> <p>After one such trip taken during a long afternoon in stagnant, ninety-degree conditions, my traveling companion&#x2015;my three-year-old son, Joshua&#x2015;was exhausted, hot and hungry. Too tired to nap and boosted by the return to the car's air conditioning, he began demanding a breast for comfort.</p> <p>While navigating the steering wheel with one hand, I reached back and patted Josh on one of his plump little legs. I knew he was becoming very tired because he was rubbing his eyes. "Honey, Momma can't nurse you right now." </p> <p>"I can't go to sleep without it, Momma. You come back here so I can have some," he cried. </p> <p>Knowing I was in for a battle, I decided to try logic. "Well, honey, if I come to the backseat with you, who will drive the car?"</p> <p>My young son looked at me as if I were just dumber than dirt. "Let Damus drive! He can drive!" Checking my rearview mirror to make sure I didn't have another passenger with me, I asked, "Josh, who is Damus?" </p> <p>With exasperation and a yawn, Josh replied, "Damus is right here, Momma. Now let him drive the car!" </p> <p>No longer in a mood to argue, I said, "Damus can't drive." <i>There!</i> I thought. <i>That should settle this!</i> It didn't. </p> <p>Looking stunned, Josh replied, "How do you know?"</p> <p>The next day, Josh and I were again on the go. While I was driving&#x2015;enjoying the scenery and the breeze that had come up&#x2015;I suddenly remembered Damus. I decided to ask Joshua a few questions about his friend. Josh was busy looking at a new dinosaur toy with huge teeth, some vicious-looking creature his father had recently bought him. I asked, "Honey, who is Damus?" </p> <p>With a growl he replied, "Oh, he's just some kid from the sky. A kid with red hair." </p> <p><i>A kid from the sky! With red hair? I silently moaned. Then I thought, Where have I gone wrong! I'm a qualified mental-health provider! Why does my child need an imaginary friend?</i> The stress of his grandfather's illness had been overwhelming, but I try to give Josh lots of hugs, attention and love. He goes to the office with me and is not neglected. And he's three years old, and I'm still breast-feeding. <i>This is just too much!</i> I was beside myself with another one of my "rotten mother" panic attacks. Once I calmed down, I decided I needed to know more about this Damus character.</p> <p>"Sweetie, how long has Damus been around?" I asked, keeping one eye on the rearview mirror and another on the beachfront street. </p> <p>"Oh, Damus just got here a few days ago," answered my son as he attacked the backseat with his fanged creature. </p> <p>"Damus just got here?" I asked. "Is he a friend of yours?" Still growling away, Josh said, "No, Mom! He just got here! He came here for Da!" "Da" was what the boys called their very ill grandfather, who was in the hospital looking very gray around the gills. </p> <p>The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I suddenly felt very chilled and overwhelmed. I pulled the car on to the beach, turned off the engine, faced my son and asked, "Joshie, is Damus here right now?" </p> <p>His green eyes were already taking in the beach. "Momma, can I go play in the water? Hey! Let's build a sand castle! Maybe we will see those jelly things on the beach!"</p> <p>Once again, I asked, "Honey, is Damus here?" </p> <p>"No, Mom. He isn't here right now. He only comes when he wants to!" my little boy replied with much irritation. He then started to crawl out of his supposedly childproof car seat. Obviously, Damus wasn't as important to him as was seeing if any jellyfish had floated to the shore.</p> <p>After playing in the ocean and running our errands, we were off again. Once in the car, I asked Josh if Damus was back. He looked to the seat beside him, smiled and said, "Yes." </p> <p>I couldn't see a thing, so I asked, "What does Damus look like, honey?" Returning his gaze to the seat next to him, Josh answered, "Mom, he looks just like a big kid." With this, he picked up his dinosaur toy and returned to his play.</p> <p>Damus was with us for the rest of November while Pop's condition continued to deteriorate. Every once in a while, Josh would announce that Damus was back and all of us&#x2015;myself, my husband Michael and my older son Aaron&#x2015;would turn to catch a glimpse of this elusive creature. None of us ever saw Damus, which was very confusing to Joshua.</p><br><br> <b>The Beginning of the End</b> <br><br> <p>On Thanksgiving Day my father-in-law was out of the hospital, and he and my mother-in-law joined us for a somewhat traditional holiday feast. Michael had cooked a turkey, upside down, and I had made a tofu pumpkin pie. In spite of our cooking, everyone had a great time. Michael and I shared family gossip with my in-laws, while the boys wrestled under the table with the dog. Pop was looking better than he had in weeks. We were all very hopeful.</p> <p>The day after Thanksgiving, Pop was hit by a huge stroke that completely paralyzed him. After this, he was no longer able to eat or talk. We also were never really sure if he understood what we were saying. The kids were absolutely devastated, especially my older son, who worshipped his six-foot-tall, bigger-than-life, war-hero grandfather. Our family was camped out at the hospital at least twelve hours a day, with different members taking shifts. More relatives flew to the island as doctors and nurses poked and prodded Pop. Being in the hospital before this major stroke had been very difficult for my father-in-law. For years he was an eye surgeon, a Frenchman who was used to giving orders and being in control. To see him laying helpless in a hospital bed was heartbreaking.</p> <p>December crept into our lives. It was the season of Hanukkah, a favorite time of the year for Jewish children. With potato pancakes, singing and merrymaking, Hanukkah was a time to celebrate with friends and relatives. Sadly, the season was difficult that year. Pop was dying and we all knew it. The only question was when. My sister Lila had flown from California to be with us, and she distracted my children with her eccentric aunt shenanigans. Having her with us was a blessing. She had been a hospice nurse and knew firsthand about the dying process. Michael and I were spending more and more days at the hospital, at the same time trying to keep everything as normal as possible at home for our sons. In spite of Pop's condition, we wanted them to have their eight nights of Hanukkah. Their Da would have wanted this for them, too.</p><br><br> <b>In the Time of Dying</b> <br><br> <p>One evening, we were hosting our annual Hanukkah dinner. The house was full of loving friends. Michael and I were bursting into tears every five minutes, while our wonderful friends took turns holding us and providing words of comfort. The stress was incredible and definitely starting to take its toll. Everybody pitched in, and we were able to make the party happen. After the Hanukkah candles were lit, the latkes devoured and the wrappings of the presents scattered across the floor, my oldest son asked, "What will happen to Da when he dies?"</p> <p>Our family had always been very open about death, and both of my young sons were full of questions, as usual. Josh reminded us all that Damus would take Da to the sky, but my oldest boy wasn't quite comfortable with this idea. As a card-carrying member of the International Association for Near-Death Studies, I was able to share with my children vivid tales of people who were close to death, yet who returned to life with visions of heavenly landscapes. Because of my role as a licensed marriage and family therapist, I had worked not only with the grieving, but also the dying. With this wealth of experience, I was able to speak about the many stories I had heard from clients who had been at death's door.</p> <p>Stories of encounters with angels and loved ones who had already passed on were common in my office. An acquaintance of mine, Dr. Raymond Moody, had written a number of bestselling books on this topic, a phenomena he called the near-death experience (NDE). I passed his works on to my mother-in-law and my oldest son. Then I decided to share with my family an experience I had with my own mother when she was passing.</p><br><br> <b>A Good-Bye Hug</b> <br><br> <p>When I was sixteen, my beloved mother died a terrible death. When she was just thirty-three, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Back then, treatment for this disease was hit-and-miss at best. By the time her thirty-eighth birthday rolled around, she was on her deathbed. At five in the morning, moments before her passing, I awoke from a deep sleep and knew intuitively that my mother was dying in the hospital. A chill ran down my spine as I arose, put on my fuzzy pink bathrobe and slippers and then went downstairs to sit by the phone. Alone in the early dawn, I could feel the sadness penetrating every cell of my being. As the sun came up over the backyard orchard of fruit trees, the tears began to slowly slide down my cheeks. My beautiful, vivacious mother was gone and I knew it. About fifteen minutes later, a dear friend of hers called our home to tell me she had died. When he shared this news with me, I quietly replied, "Yes, I already know."</p> <p>At this same time, two very good family friends were also getting out of their beds and slipping into bathrobes. They too had suddenly awakened at 5:00 a.m., miles away from the hospital in separate locations. As their eyes opened, they also knew my mother was departing this world and making her way to the next. At exactly the same moment, all three of us had known and felt that my mother was leaving us to begin her journey through the veil of the unknown. Just before my mother passed, a part of her had reached out to touch all three of us. She gave us all one final good-bye hug before she had to go.</p> <p>Researchers call what I had experienced a deathbed vision. As I shared this vision with my family, their expressions turned to wonder. I was confronted with a multitude of questions about life after death. I shared that my experience with my mother's death had proved to me that something&#x2015;some part of us&#x2015;survives after the physical body dies. I continued to explain that a deathbed vision, or DBV, is a paranormal experience or otherworldly vision that takes place&#x2015;moments, minutes, days, weeks or months before the actual death&#x2015;for either the one who is passing or for that person's survivors. </p> <p>After sharing this information with my loving crew, my husband pulled me aside and asked, "Do you think Damus has provided a deathbed vision for Josh?" Startled by Michael's revelation, I replied, "I don't know, but now that I think of it, you just might be on to something. Damus didn't show up until Pop was really sick, and Josh said Damus was here to take Da away."</p><br><br> <b>A Colorful Vision</b> <br><br> <p>That evening, Michael decided he needed some time alone with his father. I had just put the kids to bed when Michael announced he was going to spend the night with Pop in the hospital. I had tears in my eyes as I nodded silently and gave my husband a hug. Then I packed up some freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and sent them and my husband to Pop's deathbed. The next morning, my tired husband returned home looking ragged, yet at peace. The boys were upstairs watching some new video on snakes, so Michael and I sat down in the kitchen for a private talk. </p> <p>"You won't believe what happened last night," Michael said with a look of amazement in his eyes. "I feel kind of funny telling you about this," he added.</p> <p>Totally confused, I asked, "Is Pop dead?" </p> <p>"Oh no. It's nothing like that," he answered. "Last night, at about four in the morning, I had the weirdest experience." My husband is not one to share openly at the drop of a hat, and watching him begin his tale I knew I needed to remain quiet and listen. "It was about four in the morning," he repeated, "and I was sleeping in the big, overstuffed chair next to Pop's bed. I awoke to see this swirl of pastel color rising from Pop's chest. He looked so peaceful as this light swirl of . . . I don't know what . . . continued to rise. He is going to die soon, isn't he?" Michael asked as the tears rolled down his cheeks. </p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>Later on that day, I talked to my cousin Yvonne. Yvonne had also had a strange experience at the moment of her mother's passing. "The paramedics had arrived, but Dad and I knew they were too late. I sat there with my mother as she died and watched this gray wisp of vapor leave her body. As it disappeared, I knew Mother was gone." </p> <p>After sharing Michael's experience with her, she said, "Yeah, sounds like the real deal. Call me if you need help with the kids when Uncle Sava [Pop] passes."</p><br><br> <b>Angel of Death</b> <br><br> <p>It was Friday the thirteenth. We had decided to take a break from the hospital and round up the boys for a family-night service at our temple. We belong to a great Jewish community where the rabbi is called "Jimmy" and children are allowed to run wild through the temple halls when they need to burn off energy. Once a month, many of the families in the congregation bring food for a big family meal after services. Rabbi Jimmy is a wonderful, down-to-earth guy who loves not only telling stories with a message but also hearing about the mystical experiences of others. He has also experienced a bit of the "weird" in his role as a rabbi. I have always felt comfortable asking him questions that seem strange or unusual for normal conversation.</p> <p>After we had eaten, I pulled Jimmy aside and asked him if he had ever heard the term "Damus." This was all I shared with him. He suddenly took out his pen and started writing in Aramaic and then Hebrew. After pondering over his writings for a moment, he looked up and said, "Sure, <i>Damus</i> or <i>Damas</i>, depending on the spelling, translates to +messenger of death.' According to our tradition, the messenger of death or angel of death is a positive being who assists the dying. Where did you hear this term? It isn't that common."</p> <p>I was speechless! I didn't know what to say. My young son had been receiving deathbed visions. Suddenly, I started to cry. Rabbi Jimmy found my response somewhat alarming and asked "What's up?" While blowing my nose I shared with him about our strange visitor. </p> <p>His only response was "Wow!"</p><br><br> <b>Time to Move On!</b> <br><br> <p>Earlier that day, we had moved Pop from the hospital back to his room at a local elder-care facility. Both Michael and I believed he knew his time was near. Even though he could not talk, we had always known he was adamant about not dying in a hospital. Once back in his own room, with his familiar blankets, comforter and pillows, Pop seemed to relax. Michael had put a map of the world on the wall next to his bed. When I asked him why he had done this, with tears in his eyes Michael said, "I thought after he passes and leaves his body, he could use the map to help him visit those places he so loved. You know, he just loves to travel and has never gone anywhere without at ...</p></p><h2>Living on the Border of Disorder: How to Cope With an Addictive Person</h2><p>"offers a practical and healthy approach-both to the victims of disorder and to those who live in the 'network' around them."

Donleavy (1926-2017)</b> is the author of the acclaimed novel <i>The Ginger Man, </i>as well as <i>The Onion Eaters, A Singlar Man</i>, and many others. A Bronx, New York native, he lived in Dublin, Ireland.The famed author of The Gingerman shows--in this angst-and-arsenic-laced little bonbon- -that there's plenty of wit and heart in the writer yet. At 42, beautiful Mrs. Steve Jones lives a splendid life indeed in her fine mansion at number 17 Winnapoopoo Road in Scarsdale--or does, that is, until husband Steve leaves her for a bimbo: at which time Mrs. Jones, who's been born, bred (in a southern state), and educated always and only to be the finest and most tasteful and discriminating of ladies, washes her hands of him for keeps in exchange for the mansion itself and a cool hundred-sixty-five thousand. And? Well, a downward spiral follows, sadly, as inept and dishonest brokers lose huge gobs of Jocelyn's money (full name, if needed for reference: Jocelyn Guenevere Machantiere Jones), as classy neighbors begin to snub her, as she starts to drink more, and as she feels increasingly like the mad girl across the road who appears at the window from time to time, in handcuffs. Selling the mansion (after first shooting her TV set with a priceless shotgun) gives her money enough to survive by moving to an apartment in a lesser neighborhood--then to another in a still lesser neighborhood--and to continue doing the only thing she really wants, which is to make train trips into the city to visit the art museums and find clean bathrooms to pee in. One clean bathroom she knows of happens to be in a funeral parlor and--by now she's falling into true, suicidal despair--her chancing to use it at just a certain moment will have a huge effect (and at the same time none at all) on her fate. A brilliantly brief, gloriously irreverent, perfectly raunchy, wonderfully hilarious--and sad, melancholy, tearful look at one woman's life.

The Blue Beetle character&#39;s legacy reaches back into comicdom&#39;s golden age, but his latest incarnation is Jaime Reyes. A young man of Latin American descent living in El Paso, Jaime deals with the mysterious scarab that has melded with his body, manifesting as armor that gives him astonishing capabilities. Steeped in the lore of the recent DC universe and ending on a pivotal cliff-hanger, accessibility of this second volume in the Blue Beetle series is somewhat limited for new readers. But the use of an ethnicity not often seen in comic heroes, plus engaging characters and a fast-paced, rip-snorting second half make for a divertingly lighthearted take on a young man&#39;s quest to solve the secrets of himelf.

Karp, Jesse</p><h2>The Eagle and the Rising Sun: The Japanese-American War 1941-1943: Pearl Harbor through Guadalcanal</h2><p><p><strong>A fresh and provocative account of the greatest naval campaign of the twentieth century.</strong></p> Alan Schom's histories and biographies have been celebrated for their iconoclastic approach and a dramatic focus on extraordinary personalities meeting at the crossroads of history. In this magisterial history of World War II in the Pacific, he shows how the conflict was in neither the United States's nor Japan's best interest. On one hand, the American government and people were as inadequately prepared for war as any major power has ever been; on the other hand, Schom's close reading of Japanese military and political documents reveal that their supreme command knew they could not possibly win. 32 pages of photographs</p><p>Alan M. Schom is the author of the acclaimed biography Napoleon Bonaparte: A Life and several histories, including Trafalgar and One Hundred Days. He lives in France.This opinionated but cluttered history covers the dramatic slugfest in the Pacific during the first year and a half after Pearl Harbor. Schom's treatment of historiographical issues-the rise of Japanese militarism, the need for raw materials that set Japan on the path of conquest, America's woeful unpreparedness and obliviousness to warnings of the impending Pearl Harbor attack-is usually well judged, although not groundbreaking. He emphasizes naval operations, and his analysis of initial American tactical ineptitude, especially in handling aircraft carriers, is particularly acute. Schom (Napoleon Bonaparte: A Life) turns a beady eye to history's personalities here, offering gossipy character studies of its leading (and not-so-leading) participants. This approach sometimes yields pungent insights, as in his blistering attack on MacArthur, a "befuddled" self-promoter and "greatest natural-born autocrat of them all," whose bungled defense of the Philippines Schom pegs as the worst American failure of the war. But the frequent intrusion of extraneous biographical detail (e.g., "Chester Nimitz walked to school barefoot as a child") disrupts coherent thematic development, while the author's fondness for living-history tableaux ("the smiling FDR wore a Panama hat and light beige tropical suit, his cigarette at its usual jaunty angle") pads the narrative. Schom has done a lot of research, on everything from the love lives of American commanders to the London theater season during Hirohito's 1921 state visit, to a strained encounter between Roosevelt and a nude Churchill, and he seems determined to let none of it go to waste. Some readers will love this; others may find themselves wishing he would lay off the human interest and get on with the war.

Longshoreman Eddie Carbone is devoted to his wife, Beatrice, and to his niece, Catherine. When Beatrice's impoverished Sicilian cousins enter the U.S. illegally in the hope of finding work, Eddie gives them a helping hand. But when Catherine and one of the cousins fall in love, Eddie's affection for his niece turns into obsession. Directed by Peter Levin. <p>Starring: Charles Cioffi, Harry Hamlin, Jamie Hanes, Mary McDonnell, Peter Morse, Ed O'Neill, Amy Pietz, Don Tieri</p></p><p>Arthur Miller&#39;s first success came in 1947 with All My Sons for which he won the New York Drama Critics Circle award. His next play, Death of a Salesman, stunned audiences with its brilliance and was quickly became a classic of the modern theatre. It also sparked heated debates over the true nature of tragedy. Arthur Miller was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1949 for Death of a Salesman. He has come to be considered one of the greatest dramatists in the history of the American Theatre, and his plays continue to be produced worldwide.Arthur Miller's play is a bit melodramatic and uses some crude dramaturgy, but it's an entertaining period piece written in 1955 and set in Brooklyn during that era. Ed O'Neill (who played Al Bundy on "Married... With Children") is convincing as Eddie Carbone, the Italian-American longshoreman at the center of this play about obsession and betrayal. Jamie Hanes and Harry Hamlin put on passable accents as illegal Sicilian immigrants hiding out in the Carbone home. The play also benefits from judicious editing that makes the action easier to follow in an audio-only format.

But when the brutal murder and scalping of a mysterious drifter leads to a clash between cavalry soldiers and a band of Comanche Indians suspected of the killing, a full-scale Indian uprising seems likely. Worse yet, the murder of the drifter bears a disturbing resemblance to a string of killings Hank remembers from his distant and violent past as a Texas Ranger.<br> Meanwhile, Hank's twenty-year-old son, Jay Blue, and his adoptive brother, Skeeter, find themselves on the trail of a valuable Kentucky mare who vanished under their watch. The trail leads them into the dangerous haunts of outlaws and vengeful Comanche warriors. Now Hank must attempt to keep his sons safe while trying to catch a murderer who he knows will soon strike again. His ace-in-the-hole is beautiful Flora Barlow, the tavern owner with a knack for detective work.<br> Though rival lawman, Matt Kenyon, and competing rancher, Jack Brennan, complicate Hank's investigation, he and Flora slowly begin to uncover a crooked web of crime, deception, and murder.

A singer-songwriter with six CDs of his own, he lives in Marble Falls, TX. www.mikeblakely.comCountry music legend Nelson and novelist Blakely (<i>Come Sundown</i>) collaborate for this predictable western. When a rustler's body turns up on the open range outside Luck, Tex., with ghost arrows embedded in his chest, local rancher and retired Texas Ranger Hank Tomlinson's past returns to haunt him. Years earlier, three Rangers were killed by similar arrows, and many suspected Tomlinson at the time. News of the rustler's murder brings the son of one of the late Rangers, now a state police investigator, to Luck with an eye to avenging his father's death. Staying one step ahead of the law, Tomlinson races to solve the mystery and cheat the hangman. There's a wagonload of subplots (an Indian war, a prized mare's disappearance, an orphan searching out his parents, a barmaid's love story), and while rookie novelist Nelson and veteran Blakely write convincingly of the Old West, the plotting is cumbersome, the characters familiar and the dialogue strained. Nelson's legions of fans probably won't mind, though. <i>(Sept.)</i> ""<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In January 1973, Macaulay went to France to work on the first of his twenty-five books, <i>Cathedral</i>. He then constructed a colonial Roman town (<i>City</i>, 1974), erected monuments to the Pharaohs (<i>Pyramid</i>, 1975), dissected the maze of subterranean systems below and essential to every major city (<i>Underground</i>, 1976), built a medieval fortress (<i>Castle</i>, 1977), and dismantled the Empire State Building (<i>Unbuilding</i>, 1980). Macaulay is perhaps best known for <i>The Way Things Work</i> (1988). It was followed by <i>Black and White</i> (1990) for which he won the 1991 Caldecott Medal. A revised edition of <i>The Way Things Work</i> was published in 1998 followed by <i>Building Big</i>, <i>Mosque</i>, and <i>The Way We Work</i> (2008). </p><p><b>Sheila Keenan</b> is an established author of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>Greetings from the 50 States; Animals in the House: A History of Pets and People; O, Say Can You See?

This book is geared to newly independent readers who like a challenge. The material is placed within the humorous story framework of a coed soccer game. As the match proceeds, the text explains what "you" are observing at each stage and how your eyes are transferring the information to your brain. The book is formatted in an easy-reader style, with short sentences on each page. Macaulay does not shy away from sophisticated vocabulary and concepts appropriate to his subject, but both are supported by copious, clear diagrams. As the author states, this series "is intended to stimulate both verbal and visual literacy."

An enduring presence in American homes for over 30 years, Fred Rogers' plainspoken wisdom continues to guide and comfort many. This inspiring collection of stories, anecdotes, and insights distills the legacy and singular worldview of this beloved American figure.</p></p><p><strong>Fred Rogers</strong> was the host of <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</em> for over 30 years. He earned a degree in music composition and was a floor manager at NBC on their earliest shows. He studied at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Child Development. He graduated from the Seminary and was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1963, with the specific charge to continue his work with children and families through the mass media. Fred Rogers received every major award in television for which he was eligible, including two Emmys, and is a member of the Television Hall of Fame. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. He is survived by his wife, two sons, and two grandsons.For those who grew up with "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" (and their parents), this adaptation will be a reminder of the quiet, positive message of Fred Rogers: Bad things happen, and some days are better than others, but, first and foremost, each of us is lovable as we are. Rogers's wife begins with some biographical comments, which are followed by a collection of anecdotes, speech and song excerpts, and affirmations. Some are brief recordings of Rogers; the remainder are presented by an all-star quartet of narrators who read with the tones of sincerity, conviction, and respect that were Fred Rogers's trademark.

Strahd relates how he conquered the realm of Barovia, and how he became a vampire to win the love of his brother's wife, Tatyana. He tells of fratricide, suicide, treachery and a horrible curse connected to his beloved Tatyana. While this volume follows Vampire of the Mists (by Christie Golden) and Knight of the Black Rose (by James Lowder), the narrative's events seem to pre-date those of Golden's story. Although certain events and characters are depicted differently in all three novels, this is not a failing, necessarily, if readers keep in mind that this book is part of TSR's Dungeons &amp; Dragons gaming world, in which each session at the gameboard produces varying scenarios. Elrod's strong prose and excellent pacing are not diminished by being confined to the boundaries of a pre-established universe.

A man captures her and takes her home for a turtle-soup feast the next day. That afternoon, when he leaves her in his son and daughter's care and goes out to work the fields, Turtle promises to dance for the children if they let her out of the cage. Once freed, Turtle pretends to fall asleep, and subsequently escapes. The father returns home and vows to recapture the cunning animal. An ambiguous conclusion allows readers to determine Turtle's fate. An introductory source note explains that although indigenous peoples of Brazil created this folktale, it is now also told as far away as Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Although the oversized watercolor illustrations are colorful and attractive, the human faces are sometimes unnatural looking, and the little girl's arms and legs seem to grow and shrink on alternate pages. While young readers may enjoy identifying the many rain-forest animals hiding in the background scenery, the story is stronger than the art.ADenise E.

The two have much in common. Both are from blue-collar families, and their background translated into a solid work ethic on the Jets. Jets head coach Joe Walton's tirades and defensive lineman Mark Gastineau's spoiled-brat antics made Klecko and Fields's last years with the Jets uncomfortable. Both men played hurt throughout their careers, and Klecko's dismissal at the end of the 1986 season following knee surgery seems unwarranted. Neither was a supporter of the 1987 NFL players' strike, and both crossed the picket lines. They offer thoughtful comments on the strike, which resulted in sharp divisions among the players. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- Sue Kamm, Los Angeles P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Until recently Klecko and Fields were linemen for the New York Jets, Klecko on defense for 11 years and Fields on offense for 13. Both were from blue-collar backgrounds and attended colleges that were not football powers, Temple and Widener, respectively. They came into the pro game at a time when salaries were low and learned to play while injured out of fear that their temporary replacements would become permanent. Writing with News day (N.Y.) reporter Logan they show how they helped to mold the team. Their authority was eroded in 1987, however, when both, initially supporters of the players strike, crossed the picket line. Each was released at the end of the season. The book should cause something of a stir because both players admit to having used steroids and the more outspoken Klecko comments negatively about ex-teammate Mark Gastineau and coach Joe Walton.

The Osteen kids, all five of us, slept under and around the Christmas tree on the night before Christmas, telling stories and laughing and trying to guess what gifts we might be getting until we&#x2019;d finally fall asleep. Still, we celebrated Christmas Day a bit differently from many families. For us it was really a big birthday party because my father and mother emphasized the holiday&#x2019;s Christian origins as the birthday of baby Jesus, God&#x2019;s perfect present to us. If ever there were a gift that keeps on giving, it was this one.</p><p>We did exchange Christmas gifts like most families. We laughed and carried on through huge dinners of turkey and all the fixings. One thing we didn&#x2019;t do, though, was eggnog. Instead, real early Christmas morning while our parents were still nestled all snug in their bed, the Osteen boys and girls climbed out of our sleeping bags and made home brew&#x2014;coffee, that is. I probably should explain to you first off that caffeine runs in our family&#x2019;s blood. We were a coffee-drinking bunch before Starbucks ever ground its first bean. Every one of us started drinking it at a young age because of our dad, a pastor who started each day with a Bible in one hand and a mug of strong coffee in the other.</p><p>Dad&#x2019;s morning coffee was his little taste of heaven on earth. Each day, he shuffled out of bed and headed to the coffee pot first thing. Before he shaved, showered, or dressed, he had to down at least one mug of good old Folgers &#x201c;mountain grown, the richest kind of coffee,&#x201d; as the commercials said back then.</p><p>Our father, John Osteen, didn&#x2019;t just drink his morning mug of coffee; he savored it the way my wife, Victoria, relishes Godiva chocolates. For him the best part of waking up was definitely Folgers in a cup. He really made a big production of his morning coffee. I&#x2019;m still not sure whether it was for his own enjoyment or for our entertainment; probably it was both.</p><p>I would sit with my older brother, Paul, and our sisters, Lisa, Tamara, and April, around the kitchen table each morning and wait for our dad to join us with his steaming mug. Watching our dad love up that very first sip of the day was a highlight of our morning, especially his first slurp. He&#x2019;d put his lips to the cup, take a long, slow sip, and then hold the mug in the air with his eyes closed and a smile of contentment stretched across his face.</p><p>Finally, as we sat on the edge of our chairs waiting, Dad would take a deep breath, hold it, and let go a sound normally heard only from Saturday-morning cartoon characters.</p><p><i>Ahhhaaahaaaaaaaa!</i></p><p>We&#x2019;d all giggle like crazy, and then each of us would take a sip of our own cups and chime in like the children&#x2019;s choir:</p><p><i>Ahhhaaahaaaaaaaa!</i></p><p>Without fail, Dad made the same deeply satisfied sound after his first sip every morning. We laughed each and every time as if it were our first viewing of our father&#x2019;s morning ritual. Do you know, to this day every one of John Osteen&#x2019;s grown-up kids makes the same sound after our first sips of coffee each day? Some of our own kids, members of the next generation, also have adopted the <i>Ahhhhhaaahaaaa!</i> coffee habit handed down from their parents and grandfather.</p><p>This is of course just a small part of the legacy left by my father, who passed in 1999. You are likely aware that he founded Lakewood Church, which he and my mother, Dodie, built up from a small congregation packed into an old feed store. As we&#x2019;ve grown older and become parents ourselves, my brother and sisters and I notice more and more how deeply our parents&#x2019; influence comes through in our daily lives in other ways big and small, on holidays and every day too.</p><p>Paul was talking recently about our dad and his coffee habit and how he would come to breakfast each morning in his thick terry-cloth bathrobe, shuffling along in his house slippers, hair a mess, sleepy look in his eyes. Dad would cinch that robe&#x2019;s belt sash tight and way up high on his solar plexus, making him look like he weighed three hundred pounds even though he was not overweight at all.</p><p>We often teased my father about how rumpled he looked in the mornings. Paul especially enjoyed doing this, but my brother admitted awhile back that as he was walking to breakfast one recent morning, he caught sight of himself in a mirror.</p><p>&#x201c;There I was, in a big old robe knotted way up high on my belly, shuffling in my house slippers and my hair a mess,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I realized I&#x2019;d become our father!&#x201d;</p><p><b><b>RISING ABOVE</b></b></p><p>Another Osteen family tradition handed down from our dad is at the heart of this Christmas tale. First, though, I should tell you some of my father&#x2019;s history so you&#x2019;ll get the full picture. Dad grew up on a farm outside Paris, Texas, back in the horse-and-buggy days. They didn&#x2019;t have television with shows like <i>American Idol</i> back then, but they did have singing contests on the town square on Saturdays, when the farmers and their families rode into town for supplies.</p><p>My father&#x2019;s sisters thought he should enter the contest when he was all of five years old. Before they took the buggy into town, they tried to fancy him up to look more like an entertainer. His thick hair wouldn&#x2019;t stay combed the way they wanted, so his sister mixed in some egg whites as a down-home hair gel to do the trick.</p><p>Unfortunately, the hot Texas sun beat down on Dad&#x2019;s egged head during the long ride into town. By the time he made it up on stage, the rotten-egg smell in his hair was so bad that instead of singing for the crowd, he threw up on them! Our father told us that put an end to his dreams of being a singer, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure he stayed away from egg-white hair gel after that too.</p><p>In his younger days, Dad worked picking cotton on the farm owned by his father, my granddad Willis Jackson Osteen. Granddad was a successful cotton grower until the Great Depression. Like most, his family lost everything. They called themselves &#x201c;dirt poor,&#x201d; but they lost even their land when the banks crashed and Granddad had to give up farming. He didn&#x2019;t give up on life, though.</p><p>Through his friendships with other farmers, he was able to gather fresh produce, load it into his old open-sided truck, and drive into Fort Worth and Dallas, where he sold homegrown vegetables on the streets in wealthy neighborhoods. Still, times were hard, and Dad and his two brothers and two sisters didn&#x2019;t have much, growing up. My father often talked about going to bed hungry, having to put water on his breakfast cereal because there was no money for milk, putting cardboard in his shoes to cover the holes in the soles, and wearing hand-me-down clothes and pants that were too short.</p><p><b><b>BICYCLES FOR TWO</b></b></p><p>Despite the hard times, Dad had a mostly happy childhood. His family home had no electricity for the longest time, but they made the best of it. They&#x2019;d sit on the porch, and Granddad would play the fiddle and make up songs. One time when my father was a boy, his sister Mary was holding him as they listened to music by the fire. She lost her grip, and he fell into the fire, injuring his fingers so they were scarred for the rest of his life. Music didn&#x2019;t seem to be a very healthy thing for my father as much as he enjoyed it.</p><p>Dad often talked about the fact that around the holidays his family was one of those to rely on charity baskets for Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. Most of the time, he and his brothers and sisters didn&#x2019;t receive Christmas presents. I think that&#x2019;s why my father later on took so much pleasure in buying us gifts himself. Growing up, we didn&#x2019;t hear a lot about Santa Claus. In part, I think my mother and father wanted us to stay focused on the Christian meaning of the holiday, but it also may have been that my father wanted to be the one to give us Christmas gifts because he received so few as a child.</p><p>Most parents sneak around quietly and buy Christmas presents, hide them, and then on Christmas morning tell the kids that Santa brought them down the chimney. Our father often took each of us Christmas shopping one at a time so we could help him pick out gifts for our mother and the other kids. It was funny; we were like Dad&#x2019;s little helpers on those shopping trips, but he never would allow us to carry the packages. He took so much joy in buying them that I think he just wanted to savor the feeling of carrying them to the car and into the house. Maybe that, or he was afraid we&#x2019;d peek!</p><p>Early one December when I was about eight years old, Dad took me and April, who is two years younger, to look at bicycles. We didn&#x2019;t buy anything, and our father didn&#x2019;t say that day even who we were shopping for; we just looked at bikes together. A few days later, Dad pulled me aside and told me that he&#x2019;d bought April a bike. I was really excited for her, so he took me out to the back patio where he&#x2019;d hidden her new bike under a bedsheet. I wanted to look at it, but my father told me not to lift the sheet.</p><p>I was so thrilled for April, I went back every couple of days just to make sure her bike was still there. I asked Dad a few times if I could see it, but he&#x2019;d say: &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s a surprise. You have to wait until Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t understand why he wouldn&#x2019;t let me see the bike, but I never lifted the sheet. I managed to stave off temptation, though I did keep an eye on the back patio to make sure April didn&#x2019;t wander out there.</p><p>The night before Christmas all the kids slept in the den around the Christmas tree as usual. When we woke up around seven, Lisa put the coffee on so we could each have a little sip. Then our mother and father joined us, and once we&#x2019;d all had our Christmas coffee and done the day&#x2019;s <i>Ahhhhh...</i></p></p><h2>Virginia Company of London, 1606-1624 (Guides for Genealogists, Family, and Local Historians)</h2><p>This is an account of the English adventurers whose ambitions gave shape to the settlement at Jamestown and helped to see the colony through the many tribulations of its first eighteen years.

The first to make the voyage may have been a Mrs. Hudson and her maid, Frances Webb, who went in 1617 as companions to an Armenian lady who had been born in India. (Frances had a love affair on the voyage, unwittingly setting the pattern for countless women who came after her.) Over the years, India drew a few women looking for work&#x2014;as milliners, perhaps, or governesses. And some women had a calling to be missionaries. Others simply went because they had been summoned back by their families after an education in Britain.<br><br>The great majority, however, went to India because their husbands were there or because they hoped to find husbands for themselves. (To keep them chaste for the marriage market, unmarried women traveled, until well into the twentieth century, under the care of chaperones, usually married women who were making the voyage anyway.) The &#x201c;fishing fleet,&#x201d; as it was known unkindly but accurately by the nineteenth century, arrived in India in the autumn at the start of the cold weather. One lady who came out in 1779 divided what she called &#x201c;the speculative ladies&#x201d; into old maids, &#x201c;of the shrivelled and dry description,&#x201d; and girls, &#x201c;educated merely to cover the surface of their mental deformity.&#x201d; The odds were that their fishing would meet success: throughout the period of British rule in India, European men outnumbered European women by about three to one.<br><br>Understandably, few British women had cared to come to the unsettled India of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; and, what is more, the early charters of the East India Company pointedly forbade women on its posts. Its employees ignored that regulation as they did so many others. They took Indian mistresses; worse, from the point of view of the Company&#x2019;s staunch Protestant directors, they married Catholics, daughters or widows of the Portuguese. To save the souls of its men, the Company, for a time, played matchmaker. In the later part of the seventeenth century it shipped batches of young women from Britain to India. The cargo, divided into &#x201c;gentlewomen&#x201d; and &#x201c;others,&#x201d; were given one set of clothes each and were supported for a year&#x2014;quite long enough, it was thought, for them to find themselves husbands. Some did not; and the Company tried to deny that it had any obligation to look after them further. Most unfairly it also warned them to mind their morals: &#x201c;Whereas some of these women are grown scandalous to our nation, religion and Government interest,&#x201d; said a letter from London to the Deputy Governor of Bombay in 1675, &#x201c;we require you to give them fair warning that they do apply themselves to a more sober and Christian conversation.&#x201d; If that warning did not have the right effect, the women were to be fed on bread and water and shipped back to Britain. The experiment was not a happy one and it must have been with relief that the Company abandoned the practice in the eighteenth century. British women still traveled to India but they came individually.<br><br>The voyage was a dreadful one. The wooden sailing vessels, tiny by today&#x2019;s standards, were tossed about in every storm&#x2014;and the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean were famous for their storms. The passengers faced at best being thrown about in their cabins, at worst drowning. The Reverend Hobart Caunter recorded one such storm, which took place off the east coast of India in the 1830s. The weather began to turn foul early one morning. &#x201c;The only lady among us every now and then expressed her fears, when a sudden gust caused the vessel to lurch with an increased momentum, as if the billows were already commencing a fiercer conflict.&#x201d; By late afternoon, they were in the midst of a full-blown hurricane. The ship pitched violently and furniture was torn from its fastenings. More dangerously, a cannon got loose and threatened to batter a hole in the side. Even Caunter, a seasoned traveler, found the noise, coupled with the crashing of waves and the howling of the wind, &#x201c;painful in the extreme.&#x201d; Night came on and the storm increased in fury. As Caunter and the captain were in the main cabin, or cuddy, trying to carry on a conversation, &#x201c;suddenly, a heavy sea struck her astern, but happily on the quarter, and in an instant carried away the quarter-galley on that side, swamping the cabin into which the poor lady before spoken of had retired for the night. The force of the water was so great, that it dashed open the door of the cabin, and its fair occupant was borne head foremost into the cuddy, dripping like a mermaid, her hair hanging about her shoulders in thin strips, when she was rescued by the captain from further mischief. She was drenched to the skin.&#x201d;<br><br>At its shortest the voyage under sail took under two months; at its longest well over six. Sometimes the winds were so contrary on the west coast of Africa that the ships were blown off course almost to Brazil. The crew and passengers gasped with the heat; then, when they were rounding the Cape of Good Hope, they shivered in the cold. There was the danger of being dashed against the shore by a sudden shift in the winds. Those who survived often ended up in the great slave markets along the east coast of Africa. Occasionally the winds might fail altogether and the unhappy ship would sit becalmed for weeks on end.<br><br>Accommodations were cramped and dirty and often had to be shared with huge rats which scurried about, boldly eating any food that was left out and nibbling holes in clothing. Women who could afford it had cabins abovedecks. Otherwise they were housed below, in stuffy cubbyholes, often with walls made of canvas, where they had very little privacy. A bucket of salt water was the closest passengers got to a wash tub; another bucket made do for a toilet. Mrs. Sherwood, later famous as a writer of sentimental children&#x2019;s stories, accompanied her army officer husband out to India at the beginning of the nineteenth century; she had to sleep in a hammock strung above a cannon while filthy water from the bilges ran across the floor beneath.<br><br>Mrs. Eliza Fay, who lived in India in the late eighteenth century, endured the voyage several times. Fortunately she was a woman who faced difficulties (and she had many&#x2014;from imprisonment by an Indian ruler to her wastrel of a husband) in an optimistic spirit. Her letters to her sister are filled with cheerful gossip and appalling details of shipboard life. On one voyage back to England, she nearly suffocated. &#x201c;The port of my cabin being kept almost constantly shut, and the door opening into the steerage; I had neither light nor air but from a scuttle.&#x201d; On her first voyage the captain was &#x201c;overbearing and insolent&#x201d; and kept his passengers half starved. At meals, Mrs. Fay reported proudly, &#x201c;the longest arm fared best; and you cannot imagine what a good scrambler I am become.&#x201d;<br><br>When they could, women on the sailing ships escaped from their cabins to the fresh air of the deck, but that depended on both the weather and the mood of the captain. Many of the captains of the East Indiamen were quite charmingly eccentric on dry land; at sea they seemed half mad and one of their more common phobias was women. Ladies were often forced to take their meals in their cabins rather than in the cuddy because the gentlemen drank and swore so dreadfully. Mrs. Sherwood confided to her diary that &#x201c;those who have not been at sea can never conceive the hundredth part of the horrors of a long voyage to a female in a sailing vessel.&#x201d;<br><br>At the start of the voyage, there might be the luxury of fresh meat, because many ships carried cows and sheep on deck. Sooner or later, rations would get shorter, the preserved meat tougher and saltier. Water would turn the color of strong tea, with a foul smell and an even fouler taste. Minnie Blane, a happy, sheltered young middle- class girl from Bath, experienced all the unpleasantness of sailing ships when she traveled out to India in 1856 with her husband, an officer in the Indian Army. (They might have taken the shorter route overland via Egypt and enjoyed the relative comfort of steamships but her husband needed to save money.) Minnie, who was pregnant, was sick a good deal of the time and the meals she faced cannot have helped. For weeks on end, after they had rounded the Cape, the only meat was &#x201c;Pork, boiled, roasted, fried, chops, curry (with so much garlic in it, it is quite uneatable), and one leg of mutton, half raw.&#x201d; The butter was thick with salt and sugar had long since run out. Some food was quite rotten. &#x201c;I cannot tell you,&#x201d; wrote Minnie to her mother, &#x201c;how sick it made me one day, on cutting open a fig, to see three or four large white maggots lying comfortably inside!&#x201d; Cautious travelers often took a private stock of food and wine. Many women brought other little comforts along in a brave attempt to make their quarters bearable. They had their own folding chairs, washstands, linen, and even chintz curtains to hang across the door.<br><br>Soldiers&#x2019; wives had the worst time of all. The Army&#x2019;s own troopships were appalling&#x2014;leaking, dirty, and cramped&#x2014;and the transports it sometimes had to hire from private contractors were scarcely better. Since the usual class distinctions were rigidly observed at sea, officers&#x2019; ladies at least got cabins; &#x201c;wives of others ranks,&#x201d; as the Army described them, were belowdecks, often in a corner of the hold next to the horses. There they endured the voyage, sleeping, eating, and passing their days in a stench which got worse as the voyage dragged on. Unless they were working for an officer&#x2019;s wife, they had little opportunity of getting on deck.<br><br>The military authorities of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries did not approve of women and their children accompanying the troops&#x2014;only a few of the families of the ranks were permitted to go&#x2014;so they did little to make them comfortable. The Army gave them a pittance for their subsistence but no advice on what to bring with them. Mrs. Helen Mackenzie, the strong-minded and pious wife of an officer in a Sikh regiment, was horrified on her first voyage to India in the middle of the nineteeth century to discover a soldier&#x2019;s wife eating the scraps from her plate. The unfortunate woman was &#x201c;worse off than a female convict&#x201d;: she did not even have adequate clothing.<br><br>Gradually the Army was forced to modify its attitude; by the twentieth century wives usually accompanied their husbands abroad and the troopships, while never luxurious, gave them at least decent food and accommodation. After the First World War, conditions were better still; the Army even provided free baby food on board ship.<br><br>It is not surprising that passengers on those early voyages in sailing ships vented their misery and boredom in violent quarrels with each other. The men threatened each other with duels; the women gossiped viciously and absurdly cut each other dead. Every now and then there were more agreeable moments. If it was calm, the passengers danced on the deck under the stars. They celebrated &#x201c;crossing the line,&#x201d; when male passengers who had never crossed the equator before were ceremonially shaved by Neptune and his court. The biggest sailors played Mrs. Neptune and her daughters. The gentlemen were shaved with a saw and a tar brush and ducked in a tub of salt water while the ladies watched from a safe distance. Mrs. Ashmore, the prim wife of an officer, witnessed the merriment when she traveled out to India in 1840, though the scene &#x201c;soon became of too riotous a nature to admit of our remaining witnesses to it.&#x201d; (She retired to her favorite reading&#x2014;the works of Bishop Berkeley and Volney&#x2019;s Ruins of Empire.)<br><br>Occasionally (and not always by design) the ships put in briefly to shore. St. Helena in the South Atlantic was a popular spot to pick up provisions and water. The passengers could stretch their legs briefly; if they had time they might make a trip to Napoleon&#x2019;s tomb (at least until the bones were restored to the French in 1840). The Cape of Good Hope was another regular stop. The ships tied up at Simonstown, then a pretty little fishing village, and passengers hired carriages to take them to Constantia, where there were excellent local wines, and to Cape Town with its charming houses set in tidy gardens. The Dutch settlers, various ladies noted approvingly, preserved both the simple ways and the hospitality of their ancestors.<br><br>There was a much shorter way of getting to India, by boat across the Mediterranean, then by land across the narrow strip of Egypt that divided the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, and finally by boat again across the Indian Ocean. This route was first used in the eighteenth century and was eventually to supplant the one around the Cape. At first it presented as many hazards as the longer route, because Egypt, nominally under the control of the Ottoman Sultan, was quite lawless. Passengers for India gathered in Cairo until they were a large enough party to defy the bandits who lay in wait in the desert. Sometimes they joined forces with Egyptian merchants heading in the same direction. The caravans traveled with an escort of hired Arab soldiers. The men generally rode while the ladies were jolted about in a sort of litter, slung between two camels. In spite of a canopy and blinds, the unfortunate occupants nearly stifled in the heat of the day only to shudder in the sudden chill of the desert night. Mrs. Fay, who traveled in one of these in the 1770s, remembered with particular antipathy &#x201c;the frequent violent jerks, occasioned by one or other of the poles slipping out of its wretched fastening, so as to bring one end of the litter to the ground.&#x201d; In later years, men and women bounced together across the desert in crude horse-drawn vans; later still there was a railway.<br><br>The journey became much safer and much faster as the nineteenth century wore on. In 1830 the first steamer was put into service between Suez, at the head of the Red Sea, and Bombay. In 1840, the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company signed an agreement with the government of India to provide a regular service between Suez and certain Indian ports. The P&amp;O was in time to become almost synonymous with the journey to India, but there were other lines: the Anchor and the Clan Lines, which ran between Liverpool and Bombay, the Calcutta Star Line between Liverpool and Colombo, and (generally considered by the British inferior to all these) the Italian Rubatino Line from Genoa and Naples to Bombay. Steam and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 helped to shorten the trip to four weeks and even less and the whole experience became rather enjoyable. The author of Indian Outfits, a guide for women published in 1882, was quite rhapsodic. &#x201c;To those who like the sea, the voyage is very pleasant; there are generally many nice people on board, and, if troops are carried, sometimes a band, and on fine nights dancing on deck, or singing, glee parties, and so on; very often amateur theatricals are got up, and come off the night before port is reached. There is usually a library on board, and there is no reason why, with so much that is new to interest and with pleasant society, the time should not pass quickly and agreeably.&#x201d;</p><h2>Inside the Sky: A Meditation on Flight</h2><p>William Langewiesche's life has been deeply intertwined with the idea and act of flying.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty years ago his father, a test pilot, <i>wrote Stick and Rudder,</i> a text still considered by many to be the bible of aerial navigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Langewiesche himself learned to fly while still a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he shares his pilot's-eye view of flight with those of us who take flight for granted--exploring the inner world of a sky that remains as exotic and revealing as the most foreign destination.<br><br>Langewiesche tells us how flight happens--what the pilot sees, thinks, and feels.&nbsp;&nbsp;His description is not merely about speed and conquest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes the form of a deliberate climb, leading at low altitude first over a new view of a home, and then higher, into the solitude of the cockpit, through violent storms and ocean nights, and on to unexpected places in the mind.<br>In Langewiesche's hands it becomes clear, at the close of this first century of flight, how profoundly our vision has been altered by our liberation from the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we understand how, when we look around, we may find ourselves reflected in the grace and turbulence of a human sky.</p><p>William Langewiesche seems drawn to those vast, open landscapes that challenge both body and soul. In <i>Sahara Unveiled</i>, he traversed the length of that inhospitable desert from Algiers to Timbuktu, along the way limning an intimate portrait of the environment and the people who inhabit it. In <i>Inside the Sky</i> Langewiesche meditates on a different wilderness as he explores the ramifications of flight. "Mechanical wings allow us to fly," he writes, "but it is with our minds that we make the sky ours." <p> And it is chiefly flight's workings on our perceptions and our imagination that interests Langewiesche. "Flying at its best is a way of thinking.... It lets us see ourselves in context, as creatures struggling through life on the face of a planet, not separate from nature, but its most expressive agents. It lets us see that our struggles form patterns on the land, that these patterns repeat to an extent which before we had not known, and that there is a sense to them." Flying has, in fact, changed humankind's perception of itself. Discussing the borderlands along the Rio Grande, Langewiesche points out that from the air it is impossible to disregard the great differences in wealth and environment between Mexico and the United States:</p><p> "The narrowness of the view is a problem particular to the ground. Few tourists ever went to Presidio, but those who did often got the astonishing impression that the border there hardly existed. Residents, too, because they freely forded the river, could share that illusion. But from the air the view always widens.... What the ordinary aerial view really shows is exactly the opposite of a unified world."</p><p> Langewiesche writes eloquently and at length about flight's influence on politics, environmentalism, culture, and human psychology, punctuating these musings with fascinating accounts of real people--everyone from Otto Lilienthal, a 19th-century German engineer who died while testing a hang glider, to Walton Little, a computer engineer and private pilot who happened to be an eyewitness to the 1996 Valujet air disaster. Bad weather, crowded airports, plane crashes, and the physics of flying all form part of the tapestry as Langewiesche weaves history, science, philosophy, and his own experiences as a pilot into this tough, tender paean to the miracle of flight. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Praise for Sahara Unveiled by William Langewiesche<br><br>"Deploying a prose reminiscent of Paul Bowles or Bruce Chatwin . . . Sahara Unveiled often deepens to sudden insights that lift it into a spare poetry."<p><br>--New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A reader's dream. . . . With spare, lyrical cadences and cool sensuality, Langewiesche summons up the landscape itself. Sahara Unveiled has a masterful dry chill to it, a power that stays coiled and ready to spring and a prose that fits its subject as cleanly as skin to the bone."</p><p><br>--Seattle Times<br><br>"Like Charles Doughty, Freya Stark, T. E. Lawrence, Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry, and Wilfred Thesiger, Langewiesche finds places of his own amid the vast mysteries of the desert. His travels are filled with intense characters and scenes so vivid you can feel the grit between your teeth."<br>--The Advocate Literary Supplement<br><br>"Langewiesche exploits the harshness, forlornness, and political hopelessness of the vast desert to fashion an entertaining and edifying tale."</p><p><br>--New York Times</p></p><h2>The Hidden Third</h2><p>Poetry.

He moved to Florida in 1966 and began writing the novels about Florida that would make bring him lifelong recognition: The River Is Home, The Beginning, Forever Island, Angel City, Allapattah, and A Land Remembered. Smith has been nominated three times for the Pulitzer Prize: in 1973 for Forever Island, which was a 1974 selection of Reader&#x2019;s Digest Condensed Books; in 1978 for Angel City, which was produced as a movie of the week for the CBS television network; and in 1984 for A Land Remembered, which was an Editors&#x2019; Choice selection of the New York Times Book Review. In the annual statewide Best of Florida poll conducted by Florida Monthly Magazine, A Land Remembered has been ranked #1 Best Florida Book eight times. In 1985 Smith&#x2019;s lifetime work was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1999 he was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, which is the highest cultural honor bestowed by the state of Florida. In May 2002 Smith was the recipient of the Florida Historical Society&#x2019;s Fay Schweim Award as the &#x201c;Greatest Living Floridian.&#x201d; The one-time-only award was established to honor the one individual who has contributed the most to Florida in recent history. Additionally, Smith earned the 2012 Florida Lifetime Achievement Award for Writing presented by the Florida Humanities Council. The judges felt that &#x201c;Patrick Smith&#x2019;s books have been hugely significant to the citizens of Florida . . .

The first comprehensive study of Mancini's music, <i>Henry Mancini: Reinventing Film Music</i> describes how the composer served as a bridge between the Big Band period of World War II and the impatient eclecticism of the Baby Boomer generation, between the grand formal orchestral film scores of the past and a modern American minimalist approach. Mancini's sound seemed to capture the bright, confident, welcoming voice of the middle class's new efficient life: interested in pop songs and jazz, in movie and television, in outreach politics but also conventional stay-at-home comforts. As John Caps shows, Mancini easily combined it all in his music.&nbsp;Mancini wielded influence in Hollywood and around the world with his iconic scores: dynamic jazz for the noirish detective TV show <i>Peter Gunn,</i> the sly theme from <i>The Pink Panther,</i> and his wistful folk song "Moon River" from <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i><i>.</i> Through insightful close readings of key films, Caps traces Mancini's collaborations with important directors and shows how he homed in on specific dramatic or comic aspects of the film to create musical effects through clever instrumentation, eloquent musical gestures, and meaningful resonances and continuities in his scores. Accessible and engaging, this fresh view of Mancini's oeuvre and influence will delight and inform fans of film and popular music.&nbsp;John Caps is an award-winning writer and producer of documentaries. He served as producer, writer, and host for four seasons of the National Public Radio syndicated series <i>The Cinema Soundtrack,</i> featuring interviews with and music of film composers.

Ukiyo-e, depictions of this shadowy projection of the human mind, formed the mainstay of Japanese paintings and woodblock prints produced between the 17th and 20th centuries. <br><br>YOKAI: &#x201c;Ghost; apparition; phantom; spectre; demon; monster; goblin.&#x201d; Taking this definition to include mystic visions and mythic or monstrous beasts, this book collects more than one hundred 19th century Japanese woodblock prints whose subject matter covers the entire spectrum of the supernatural and the outlandish. The selection of works is also limited to the triptych format, which gave ukiyo-e artists the freedom to express their phantasies as narratives in a kinetic, detailed image frame. The work of over twenty different artists is featured, spread over five different categories &#x2013; kaiju (&#x201c;strange beasts&#x201d;), yurei (&#x201c;ghosts&#x201d;), oni (&#x201c;demons&#x201d;), juryoku (&#x201c;mystic forces&#x201d;), and yojutsu (&#x201c;black magic&#x201d;). The book also has a special section for yakusha-e, prints directly depicting supernatural scenes from the kabuki theatre.</p><p>Ringo Yoshida was born and lives in Osaka, Japan.

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Read by Jim Dale<br>Running time: 11 hrs., 48 mins. 10 CDs. <br>For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. <br>Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.</p><h2>Fingerprint No. 2: The Evolution of Handmade Elements in Graphic Design</h2><p>For many designers, creating things by hand is a reaction to too much computer-based design.

Williams caught them in the act of exploring and defining their careers and music - while ensuring impassioned audiences and atmospheric venues remained inseparable from the iconic history he was chronicling. From Miles Davis to Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie to Stan Getz and Sarah Vaughan, Williams' camera witnessed genius at work, rest and play, with an honesty and clarity that few photographers could replicate.<br><br>When Williams died in 2009 at the age of 84, he left nearly 100,000 prints and negatives behind - many of which have never been seen before. Jazz, the first book dedicated to the jazz photography of Ted Williams, will highlight hundreds of these unseen jazz images and will be captioned throughout by his own memories along with commentary from some of the leading jazz historians and journalists working today.<br><br>Artists include Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ray Charles, Charlie Parker, Sarah Vaughan, Thelonious Monk, Dinah Washington, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Tony Bennett, Mahalia Jackson, Buddy Rich, Julian "Cannonball" Adderley, Art Blakey, Benny Goodman, Charles Mingus, Quincy Jones, Sonny Rollins, Muddy Waters, Max Roach, Woody Herman and Wynton Marsalis</p><p>Ted Williams was active on the jazz scene from the late &#39;40s until the late &#39;70s. He photographed many of the greats in jazz, including Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan and Louis Armstrong. His photo library contains over 90,000 images and over 300 jazz artists. Along with his prolific jazz photography, Williams also took assignments to shoot wars, sports and international cultures. His photos have appeared in Time, Newsweek, Playboy, Ebony, JazzTimes and DownBeat. Williams died on October 13, 2009.The best jazz photographer in the world.

The daughter got away. Now she is nearly eighteen and tired of living in secrecy. Under the name Melanie Denison, she has spent the last fifteen years in small-town West Virginia as part of the Witness Protection Program. She has never been allowed to travel, go to a school dance, or even have internet at home. Precautions must be taken at every turn, because Ramsey Miller was never caught and might still be looking for his daughter. Yet despite strict house rules, Melanie has entered into a relationship with a young teacher at the local high school and is now ten weeks pregnant. She doesn't want her child to live in hiding as she has had to. Defying her guardians and taking matters into her own hands, Melanie returns to Silver Bay in hopes of doing what the authorities have failed to do: find her father before he finds her. Weaving in Ramsey's story in the three days leading up to the brutal crime, Before He Finds Her is a stirring novel about love and faith and fear--and how the most important things can become terribly distorted when we cling to them too fiercely.</p><p><b>Michael Kardos</b> is the Pushcart Prize-winning author of the novel <i>The Three-Day Affair</i> and the story collection <i>One Last Good Time</i>.

Sandra Knapp's text weaves scientific, historic, cultural, and artistic threads into a rich fabric of plant lore and tells the remarkable stories of the adventurous botanist explorers who braved disease, slave traders, war, jungles, and assorted dangers to collect plants now commonly grown in our gardens. With the aid of striking illustrations, Flora considers the compelling link between botanical art and the exploration of plant form and function, thus allowing us to appreciate and enjoy them all the more. The Library of the Natural History Museum is a repository for one of the most exciting and comprehensive collections of natural history literature and artworks to be found anywhere in the world. It holds&nbsp;more than&nbsp;half a million artworks, comprising one of Britain's biggest art collections and representing all the great natural history artists. <i>Flora </i>was previously titled Plant Discoveries.</p></p><p>Fashion photographer Nick Knight shows his love for the pressed flower and plant collection of the Museum of Natural History of London in <i>Flora</i>. Each specimen is carefully chosen and photographed. Deciding between beautiful plants was quite a task for Knight: "The herbarium ... contains over six million samples. It has taken over three and a half years to discover plants for this book. Thousands were taken out for consideration.... I would look forward to each day of searching enormously." The 46 full-color plates pop so vividly from the white backgrounds that it's almost as if there were actual pressed flowers between the pages. The specimens are graceful, geometric, twisted, or spindly with colorful petals, leaves, and seeds. In their flattened arrangements, they look otherworldly, like sea creatures or insects frozen in time. The book includes a detailed commentary of the various flora and fauna written by botanical curator Sandra Knapp. She offers great information, including the history and human uses of the various flowers and plants along with the relationships between different plant species. There is a real energy to her descriptions--the flora become a cast of characters, each with personality and fascinating quirks that only nature can provide. <i>--J.P.

More than that, he was playing the character he portrayed on TV, the shy, likable, brilliant detective, Paul Travis. The gorgeous-but-doesn't-know-it Paul Travis. He was dipping his head down and glancing up at me as though he expected me to swoon over the sheer beauty of him, but I wasn't even close. When you're married to a man like Adam Montgomery, other men don't compare.<br><br>I sat down across from him and began concentrating to try to force him to stop acting and tell me the truth.<br><br>This wasn't what I wanted to be doing but my mother had sent me a letter. It was the first letter I'd ever received from her so of course it had an impact on me. It said, "You owe me." Stuck in the letter was a photo of the actor, Lincoln Aimes.<br><br>The letter puzzled me for days. Of course I knew what she meant: You owe me for saving your life, so pay me back. But what did she want me to do with the beautiful black actor?<br><br>Was my mother asking me to do what I could to get the man to be her next lover? That didn't make sense because my mother certainly didn't need anyone's help in getting a man, even a man much younger than she was.<br><br>After I received the letter and photo, I got on the Internet and ordered the DVDs of the first four seasons of Lincoln Aimes's TV show, <i>Missing.</i> The character Paul Travis didn't appear until the sixth show of the first season and then only in a small role, but he was such a hit that they asked him to become a leading character. At least that's what the brochure that came with the DVDs said. When I searched the Internet I read that the actor had had problems finding roles that cast him as anything other than a body and a face.<br><br>Poor guy, I thought. We should all have such problems.<br><br>It seemed that Lincoln Aimes wanted to play meaty parts. You know, something like a society outcast, the guy who was given bad parents and poverty, but manages to rise above that and become the first American president with no scandal attached to him.<br><br>Instead, casting agents took one look at Lincoln Aimes's perfect face, his perfect body, and cast him...well, as a sort of dumb blond. With honey-colored skin.<br><br>I read that Lincoln Aimes took a few roles, none of which he liked, then was out of work for a couple of years. I guess he got hungry because he finally accepted a small part on the hit detective series Missing, which each week looked for a missing person. After just one appearance, he became one of the three main characters.<br><br>What made the role work was that, in a way, it made fun of Lincoln Aimes's exceptional beauty. When the cast was working on a case, the character of Paul Travis was all business. He unraveled clues, was great at sizing people up, and had a real knack for putting himself into the mind of a missing person.<br><br>What he didn't know was that behind his back, everyone was talking about how gorgeous he was. It was a running joke throughout the show. The other characters constantly used him for such things as getting the angry woman in records to put their requests on the top of the pile. Paul Travis, or just Travis, as everyone called him, would hand the woman the request, speak to her in a businesslike way, then walk away. The camera would show her sighing and saying, "Yes, Travis," then immediately feeding the info into the computer. The next second she'd take the head off some ugly guy who complained that he'd been waiting for the same information for three days.<br><br>The whole premise was hokey and bordered on the ridiculous, but it enlivened a show that was like too many others already on TV. It was fun to see witnesses do double takes when they saw Travis. And it was fun to tune in each week to see what the writers came up with to show off Lincoln Aimes's beauty.<br><br>Yes, it was a good show, and I, like most of America, watched it regularly. Of course no one believed a person could be so good-looking and not know it, but it was a nice thought. It made the viewer smile when Travis said in wonder, "That man offered me a job as a male stripper. Weird, huh?" We viewers chuckled with the characters in the show. And each week we tuned in to see if maybe they were going to tell us something about Travis's personal life -- but they never did. We saw other characters' wives, husbands, apartments, kids. But never anything at all about Travis's personal life. If it didn't happen to him at work, it was never shown.<br><br>So now the actor who played Paul Travis was sitting in my living room, looking at me shyly, as though he thought I'd believe he was who he played. But he was lying to me.<br><br>I stared at him hard and concentrated, and was soon rewarded with seeing him raise his head and look at me straight-on, with no head-ducking.<br><br>"Your mother said you could help me find my son." He had to take a deep breath to get the words to come out, and I could feel that he was very nervous. About what? I wondered.<br><br>As for the child, I wondered about that. From what I knew of the actor, he wasn't married, never had been, and had no kids.<br><br>Of course he had a girlfriend: Alanna Talbert, the darling of the screen, "the woman most men wanted to have an affair with," as some poll said. She was tall, thin, had cheekbones that could cut glass, and was as perfect physically as Lincoln Aimes was. She, too, was African-American.<br><br>"I didn't know you had a son," I said as I stalled for time. I wanted to know how much my mother had told him about me.<br><br>"Neither did I," he said, then gave me another look in the character of Paul Travis.<br><br>"You want to cut that out and tell me what it is you want?" I snapped at him.<br><br>He blinked at me a few times and I could feel his consternation. Obviously, he wasn't used to being spoken to like that by a heterosexual woman. The truth was, I have certain, well, abilities that make me able to see...I hate to say that I can see "inside" a person, but I guess that's what happens. I can't read minds but I do have very, very strong intuition. And right now my intuition said that this man thought he could talk me into doing anything he wanted.<br><br>Maybe if I gave him an itty-bitty bit of a headache he'd stop posing, I thought. Maybe he'd tell me what he wanted, I could say no, then he'd go away. I wanted to get back to doing what I did every day, which was lie on the couch in my bedroom and concentrate on my missing husband.<br><br>"I -- " he began, then stopped as he got up to walk around the living room. It was a pretty room, done in peaches, yellows, and blues. Until a year ago, it was the happiest room on earth.<br><br>He looked back at me and I could feel that he'd released some of the hostility I'd sensed when I first met him, but I could still tell he thought I was someone not quite trustworthy. I couldn't very well hold that against him, could I? Not after what that...that man had written about me. The whole world called me the Hillbilly Honey. I was the laughingstock of America. Until my husband and his sister disappeared, that is. Then I became the most hated person in America. People believed I'd murdered my husband to collect his inherited money. I told everyone, the police, the reporters, all of them, that I knew in my heart that my husband and sister-in-law were still alive, but no one listened to me.<br><br>So now here I was, alone, hiding from the world, and this man was asking me to help him find his son.<br><br>And I knew that he was either lying or hiding something big.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Deveraux, Inc.</p><h2>Breakdown</h2><p><p>Paralysis. Stuttering. The 'shakes'. Inability to stand or walk. Temporary blindness or deafness.</p><p>When strange symptoms like these began appearing in men at Casualty Clearing Stations in 1915, a debate began in army and medical circles as to what it was, what had caused it and what could be done to cure it. But the numbers were never large.</p><p>Then in July 1916 with the start of the Somme battle the incidence of shell shock rocketed. The high command of the British army began to panic. An increasingly large number of men seemed to have simply lost the will to fight. As entire battalions had to be withdrawn from the front, commanders and military doctors desperately tried to come up with explanations as to what was going wrong. 'Shell shock' - what we would now refer to as battle trauma - was sweeping the Western Front.</p><p>By the beginning of August 1916, nearly 200,000 British soldiers had been killed or wounded during the first month of fighting along the Somme. Another 300,000 would be lost before the battle was over. But the army always said it could not calculate the exact number of those suffering from shell shock. Re-assessing the official casualty figures, Taylor Downing for the first time comes up with an accurate estimate of the total numbers who were taken out of action by psychological wounds.

He shines a light on the official - and brutal - response to the epidemic, even against those officers and doctors who looked on it sympathetically. It was, they believed, a form of hysteria.

Worlds in Collision - written in a brilliant, easily understandable and entertaining style and full to the brim with precise information - can be considered one of the most important and most challenging books in the history of science. Not without reason was this book found open on Einstein&#39;s desk after his death. For all those who have ever wondered about the evolution of the earth, the history of mankind, traditions, religions, mythology or just the world as it is today, Worlds in Collision is an absolute MUST-READ!</p><p>Worlds in Collision is a special, an extraordinary book - not only by its contents, but also by the response it has received.<br> <p>It is one of the few scientific books of the past centuries that have a direct profound importance for humanity - individuals and society alike. In fact it is a book that puts our present view of the world on a whole new fundament - not in some abstract specialized disciplines remote from practical life, but in a broad range of areas like astronomy, cosmology, physics, geology, paleontology, biology, history, archaeology, literature, ethnology, theology, mythology, psychology; and in addition it has an important influence on the way man sees himself individually and socially.<br> </p><p>It is the first time in centuries that a scientist didn't choose the direct way to his specialized colleagues in order to make the results of his research known, but addressed himself to the general public in a simple and clear language and presentation - for which he was harshly punished by the scientific establishment.<br> </p><p>It is exactly this reaction from representatives of the "objective" sciences - that even match some medieval practices - which shows that this book deeply shakes the foundations of our knowledge - and belief. Because of this book being so special, it has deeply penetrated the consciousness of many people. Others however have preferred to forget it - or at least would like to do so. Due to this purposeful oblivion a younger generation doesn't even know about it any more, although today - almost 60 years after its first publication - it hasn't become less of a subject. On the contrary due to new results of scientific research and recent geological and climatic developments its importance has even increased. This, too, is something special in the flood of today's short-lived literary and scientific `flash in the pans'.<br> </p><p>It is important for everyone of us and for science at large to deal with this book. Therefore we are happy to take upon ourselves the responsible task of making the complete works of Immanuel Velikovsky - not just this book - available to the public again in its unchanged form. Publishing this book - and this unfortunately also is something special for non-fiction - has required a fair amount of courage, which we proudly and consciously muster up.</p>Worlds in Collision is a book of wars in the celestial sphere that took place in historical times. In these wars the planet earth participated too. This book describes two acts of a great drama: one that occurred thirty-four to thirty-five centuries ago, in the middle of the second millennium before the present era; the other in the eighth and the beginning of the seventh century before the present era, twenty-six centuries ago. Accordingly this volume consists of two parts, preceded by a prologue.<br> <p>Harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestrial spheres is the point of departure of the present-day concept of the world as expressed in the celestial mechanics of Newton and the theory of evolution of Darwin. If these two men of science are sacrosanct, this book is a heresy. However, modern physics, of atoms and of the quantum theory, describes dramatic changes in the microcosm - the atom - the prototype of the solar system; a theory, then, that envisages not dissimilar events in the macrocosm - the solar system - brings the modern concepts of physics to the celestial sphere.<br> </p><p>This book is written for the instructed and uninstructed alike. No formula and no hieroglyphic will stand in the way of those who set out to read it. If, occasionally, historical evidence does not square with formulated laws, it should be remembered that a law is but a deduction from experience and experiment, and therefore laws must conform with historical facts, not facts with laws.<br> </p><p>The reader is not asked to accept a theory without question. Rather, he is invited to consider for himself whether he is reading a book of fiction or non-fiction, whether what he is reading is invention or historical fact. On one point alone, not necessarily decisive for the theory of cosmic catastrophism, I borrow credence: I use a synchronical scale of Egyptian and Hebrew histories which is not orthodox.</p></p><h2>Van Gogh (Phaidon Classics)</h2><p><p><b>Phaidon&#x2019;s classic illustrated monograph on Van Gogh, updated with an elegantly crafted design for today&#x2019;s burgeoning art aficionados.</b></p><p>Reviving a much beloved group of artist monographs from the Phaidon archive, the new <i>Phaidon Classics</i> bring to life the fine craftsmanship and design of Phaidon books of the 1930s, 40s and 50s.

One key factor in this progress was the founding of Phaidon Press in 1923... Last year Phaidon embarked on a major project to produce a new series of 'Phaidon Classics'... A major decision has been to update the selection of images and the catalogue notes, but to retain the original essays, adding instead a preface by a contemporary scholar.

Now Halmoni is taking the girl back to Korea for a memorial celebration of her late husband's birthday, and it is Yunmi's turn to feel like an outsider. Halmoni, who was so isolated and lonely in New York, is greeted by a large and loving family. Even her cat and dog welcome her back. Yunmi's cousins act as tour guides to the sights of Seoul, and the girl helps prepare Korean dumplings for the picnic at Grandfather's grave. At the memorial, worries overwhelm her. Halmoni seems so happy here that she may not want to return to New York. Not surprisingly, the woman reassures her American granddaughter, "We're lucky because we both have two families." This gentle, predictable story is more an introduction to Korean customs than a plot-driven narrative. Realistic illustrations of Yunmi's family, framed with borders suggesting Korean fabric design, add greatly to the book's appeal.

This is Barry Unsworth, the master of resonant historical fiction, on top form."&#x2015;Jim Crace</strong></p> Set in the Middle Ages during the brief yet glittering rule of the Norman kings, <em>The Ruby in Her Navel</em> is a tale in which the conflicts of the past portend the present. The novel opens in Palermo, in which Latin and Greek, Arab and Jew live together in precarious harmony. Thurstan Beauchamp, the Christian son of a Norman knight, works for Yusuf, a Muslim Arab, in the palace's central finance office, a job which includes the management of blackmail and bribes, and the gathering of secret information for the king. But the peace and prosperity of the kingdom is being threatened, internally as well as externally. Known for his loyalty but divided between the ideals of chivalry and the harsh political realities of his tumultuous times, Thurstan is dispatched to uncover the conspiracies brewing against his king. During his journeys, he encounters the woman he loved as a youth; and the renewed promise of her love, as well as the mysterious presence of an itinerant dancing girl, sends him on a spiritual odyssey that forces him to question the nature of his ambition and the folly of uncritical reverence for authority. With the exquisite prose and masterful narrative drive that have earned him widespread acclaim, Barry Unsworth transports the reader to a distant past filled with deception and mystery, and whose racial, tribal, and religious tensions are still with us today. Reading group guide included.</p><p>Barry Unsworth (1930-2012), who won the Booker Prize for Sacred Hunger, was a Booker Prize finalist for Morality Play and was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize for The Ruby in Her Navel.I<br>WHEN NESRIN THE DANCER became famous in the courts of Europe, many were the stories told about the ruby that glowed in her navel as she danced. Some said it had been stolen by a lover of hers--who had gone to the stake for it--from the crown of King Roger of Sicily, others that it had been a bribe from Conrad Hohenstaufen for her help in a plot to kill that same king. The plot had failed, they said, but she had kept the ruby and paid for it in a way that contented Conrad even more than the death of his enemy, vindictive as he was. As time passed the stories ranged further and grew wilder: the gem was a gift from the Caliph of Bagdad; it was sent her by secret courier from the Great Khan of the Mongols, with promises of more wealth if she would only come and dance for him and share his bed. And of course there were those who said that Nesrin was a shameless woman and the ruby was the reward of her pledge with the Devil. The troubadour who accompanied her made songs about the ruby, some happy, some sad, and this confused people even more. Neither of these two ever told the truth of it, no matter who asked, whether prince or peasant. I am the only one who knows the whole story: I, Thurstan.<br><br>Any human life lies in the future as well as in the past, of however short duration that future may prove to be; the two are hinged together like a door that swings, and that swinging is the present moment. To begin a story one must choose a time when the door swings wide, and this came for me on a day late in April of 1149 when Yusuf Ibn Mansur asked me to remain with him at the end of what we called the majlis, the gathering of officials that was held twice monthly in the royal palace of Palermo.<br><br>He asked me quite openly, rather carelessly, as if it was an afterthought, something that might have easily been overlooked. But it was rare indeed that Yusuf overlooked anything. What better way of disarming suspicion than to speak in the hearing of all? There was nothing strange about my remaining there, about our having things to say in private: he was the Lord of the Diwan of Control and I was his subordinate in the same chancery. But secrecy was ingrained in him; and he knew, as I knew--indeed, it was one of the things he had striven to teach me in the years I had served under him--that secrecy is best served by an appearance of openness.<br><br>The majlis itself has stayed in my memory because it was enlivened by a quarrel. I had only recently returned from Naples, where I had made an attempt to bribe the Count's jester, a dwarf named Leo, to return with me to Palermo as a gift to the King. Though much tempted, he had refused, being afraid of the Count's wrath, of being followed and strangled. This mission I had undertaken in my capacity as Purveyor of Pleasures and Shows, my official title in the Diwan of Control, a resounding one, but in fact there was only myself and my clerk and bookkeeper Stefanos and the doorman. I did not speak of this failure at the majlis; it was my practice in any case to say as little as possible at these meetings. I was distrusted as a man who belonged nowhere. I worked for a Moslem lord, I was not a Norman of France, being born in northern England of a Saxon mother and a landless Norman knight. My father brought us to Italy in the Year of Our Lord 1125, when I was still a child. He hoped to find advancement under the Norman rule, and he did so. My mother died some years later, struggling to give me a brother. My father . . . But more of my father later.<br><br>It was the eunuch Martin, a palace Saracen, that brought on the quarrel. He had words to say about a disrespectful incursion into the women's quarter of the palace on the part of certain drunken Norman knights. Spokesman for the Normans that morning was William of Vannes, who hotly denied the charge, clenching his huge fists and glaring at wizened Martin, in his green turban and saffron robe, as if he would like to pound him to pieces, which he would have been easily able to do. It is the Norman character to stress what they know causes adverse judgment. William knew the contempt of Greek and Arab alike for Norman uncouthness and barbarity, and he spoke the more loudly and roughly for it in the only language he knew, a dialect of northern France very difficult to follow. And Martin concealed whatever fear he may have felt and gave him look for look and repeated the charges in his querulous high-pitched voice. Only the presence of Yusuf, the host on this occasion and of a rank higher than either, restrained them from insult more personal and direct.<br><br>There were always tensions and hostility among us, moving just below the surface like a slow flame in damp grass. But open quarrels were rare, which is why this one has remained in my mind. Slight in itself, it was a mark of the deeper divisions that were opening among us, the rivalry for the King's favor between the Saracens in the palace service and the Norman nobility, a rivalry that was to grow fiercer in the time that followed.<br><br>Apart from this, what chiefly lives in my mind from that day, those hours, the beginning of my story, is a sort of amazement at the slightness and triviality of our words at such a time. Rarely had things looked worse for the Kingdom of Sicily than they did in this spring of 1149. A combined Venetian and Byzantine fleet was blockading Corfu and threatening Sicilian control of the Epirus coast and the Southern Adriatic. Conrad Hohenstaufen and Manuel Comnenus, rulers respectively of the Western and Eastern empires, the two most powerful men in the world, sworn enemies of our King, were now, after years of mutual distrust, dismayingly close in friendship and alliance, united in the purpose of invading Sicily and crushing our kingdom while still in its infancy: less than twenty years were gone by since our good Roger of Hauteville had been invested and anointed in the cathedral of Palermo, made King of Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia, the first Norman--the first of any race--to wear the crown. It was most of my years of life, but it was not long for a kingdom.<br><br>I cannot now remember what was said after this altercation, as if these few moments of heat had melted away what followed. I suppose my attention wandered. I had always liked this room, which was an antechamber to the two beyond, where the main work of our diwan was conducted. The ceiling was of wood, the work of Saracen carvers, very delicately fretted, with painted stars between the bosses. There was a thin band of Greek scrollwork in marble, running all round the walls, a frieze of tendrils and fronds. As sometimes before, I let my gaze follow the curves of the scroll and I was soon lost and mazed in them; each loop turned back on itself, doubled round to form the first curving line of a new loop; there was no break in it, no beginning and no end: wherever the eye fell, the mind was snared.<br><br>It happens to me when I dwell thus on the detail of form, when I look closely at things that are wrought for beauty and the upholding of power, my mind loosens and in some way dissolves and I feel the touch of heaven in the gross material of wood or stone. It has been with me from my early days, this sense of a crossing point between man and God that can lie in the work of hands. And on that April morning, still, the touch of heaven was the touch of my King, whose power was celebrated in that wood and that stone. My trance of mind was wonder at God's power and the King's; the voices around me still sounded, now loud, now soft, but the voice I heard was that unwavering one of majesty.<br><br>This drift of attention I would not have confessed to Yusuf, for fear it would damage me in his eyes--I wanted always to have his approval, though whether this was for increased pleasure in my own worth or to save him from disappointment I do not know. Can such things be truly known? In any case, suspicious as he was, I do not think he would have suspected such lapses on my part; they were too far from his own practice of unremitting alertness. Anything could be useful, could be vital, even the smallest thing, the very smallest--who could know? The sign of treason can lie in the flicker of an eyelid, he had once said to me. Without this acumen in seeing the signs, what can avail the rack and the wheel? So he tried to mold me and so I tried to fit the shape. As I say, I wanted to please him. But I was lacking, I was not an apt pupil--I knew it even then.<br><br>When we were alone I stood silently before him, awaiting his words. But he took my arm without speaking and walked with me to the smaller chamber that lay beyond, where his notary and scribes did their work, and through this to his own cabinet, closing the heavy door behind us and leading me to the narrow space within the embrasure of the window. It was no more than the habit of caution, bred by his many years in the palace service. I did not take it to mean that the matter was serious, nor did his first words give me any indications of this.<br><br>"Well, Thurstan Beauchamp," he said, "is that a new sorcot I see this morning?"<br>"Yes," I said, "so it is."<br><br>He made game of me sometimes about my extravagance in dress, using, with an accent of irony, the French terms that had become fashionable of recent months in Palermo. I like to be clean and neat and make a good figure, and I took much care with my appearance, shaving twice every week and spending a good part of my stipend on clothes and scent and oil for my hair, which is very light in color and reaches to my shoulders. That morning I was wearing a coat of dark blue silk, padded at the shoulders and pinched in the sleeves.<br><br>"And the chainse, that too? And the chauces?"<br><br>He smiled as he spoke and I returned the smile, knowing these questions were a way he had found of showing affection for me. No, I told him, the shirt was not new, but more of the embroidery showed because my new coat was cut low at the neck. I was rather relieved that he made no jokes on this occasion about my singing. He had discovered--but he discovered everything--that I had a ...</p><h2>The High Mountains of Portugal</h2><p>In three loosely related stories, Martel, the author of Life of Pi, follows a young man searching for a precious relic, a pathologist performing a surreal autopsy, and a Canadian widower returning to his native village in Portugal and befriending a chimpanzee.</p><p>Yann Martel is the author of a short story collection, The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios, and of four novels, Self, Beatrice &amp; Virgil, Life of Pi (for which he was awarded the 2002 Man Booker Prize), and his latest, The High Mountains of Portugal.

The Channel Islands hold a unique place in British history, not least because during the Second World War they were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by the Nazis. For five long years the Swastika flew here in place of the Union Jack and all the worst excesses of Nazi rule were present in some form or other. The iron fist in the velvet glove policy did not last long. The Secret Field Police employed Gestapo operatives on secondment and many Islanders soon experienced the horror of the early morning knock on the door leading to brutal interrogation in a manner familiar elsewhere in occupied Europe. Only those who experienced the Occupation know the anguish of it. Many thousands of Channel Islanders received prison sentences of one kind or another for contravening the law of the jackboot. To be a Jew was a crime under the anti-Semitic laws and even keeping a radio to listen to the BBC news broadcasts meant a stiff prison sentence. Many Islanders went further, assisting Russian slave workers and others on the run, eventually being sentenced to terms in French prisons or concentration camps such as Ravensbruck and Belsen. In some cases they died there. As in all occupied countries a small number of people collaborated with the enemy. That fact is meaningless when considered in the context of the unfailing loyalty of the vast majority of Channel Islanders who stubbornly persisted in the face of armed might and brute force in fighting their own war of non co-operation. They never lost faith in their belief that one day liberation would come. Living with the Enemy is a stunning account of how a small population with a belief in themselves, their own integrity and loyalty to the Crown were able to stand up to a country which at the time controlled the whole of Europe but most importantly played their own part in the eventual destruction of the Third Reich.

In the 1940s, the eminent British botanist John Heslop Harrison proposed a controversial theory: Species of plants on the islands off the west coast of Scotland, he said, had survived the last Ice Age. His premise flew in the face of evidence that the last advance of the ice sheets extended well south of mainland Scotland, but he said he had proof&#x2014;the plants and grasses found on the Isle of Rum&#x2014;that would make his name in the scientific world. Harrison didn't anticipate, however, the tenacious John Raven, an amateur botanist who boldly questioned whether these grasses were truly indigenous to the area, or whether they had been transported there and planted. What seems at first a minor infringement of academic honesty soon becomes an enthralling tale of rival scientists and fraudulent science, a skillful whodunit that, in the hands of the talented Sabbagh, joins the ranks of the best narrative nonfiction.</p><p>Take a garrulous old university professor with a knack for making extraordinary (and highly suspicious) botanical discoveries, a scientific community becoming increasingly skeptical of his claims, and an amateur botanist keen to find out the truth, and the stage is set for an absorbing tale of scientific chicanery and academic intrigue.<p> Professor John Heslop Harrison of Newcastle University was one of the most respected and knowledgeable botanists of the first half of the 20th century. His greatest passion was for the plants of the Hebridean islands off the west coast of Scotland. He came to believe that some of the islands' plants were survivors from a time before the last Ice Age, a theory bound to be controversial given that the last advance of the ice sheets extended well south of mainland Scotland. In support of his theory, Heslop Harrison began to report sightings of plants that no one had ever seen on the islands before, and the botanical community started to get suspicious. Were the plants really where Heslop Harrison claimed they were? If so, how did they get there? Could they really have survived on the islands since the last interglacial? Or had the wily old professor carried the specimens to the Hebrides from their sites of origin and planted them?</p><p> Karl Sabbagh relates the shady tale of John Heslop Harrison in his highly engaging book <i>A Rum Affair</i> (Rum is the name of the Hebridean island where Harrison made many of his most extraordinary--and suspicious--discoveries). Sabbagh examines the thoughts, actions, and motivation of Harrison and his academic enemies with great aplomb, and goes on to explore how some scientists are driven to the belief that fakery can be in the interest of science. Sabbagh's writing style is sometimes dry and detailed, as befits the treatment of a rather touchy subject, but the book is also laced with absorbing anecdotes and wry humor. It's a winner in a popular history of science genre that is becoming a bit overpopulated these days. --<i>Chris Lavers, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Karl Sabbagh</b> earned his degree at King's College, Cambridge, before joining BBC Television.

I set up my own business and called myself an "artist`s consultant." Today, I refer to my profession as a "career coach and artist advocate," a job title that better describes the work that I do. Ranging in age from twenty-one to eighty-five, clients have included painters; sculptors; printmakers; fiber artists; poets; playwrights; novelists; cartoonists; journalists; photographers; craft artists; theater and film directors; film and video artists; performing artists; choreographers; dancers; classical, jazz, and pop musicians and composers; and opera singers. They have included well-known artists, unknown artists, beginning artists, self-taught artists, midlife career changers, artists fresh out of school, and college dropouts. My clients have also included groups of artists, artist couples, arts administrators, curators, gallery dealers, art consultants, critics, arts service organizations, and theater and dance companies. I have assisted a rabbi, a retired executive of Macy`s department store, a retired host of a television variety show, a gossip columnist, ex-offenders, corporate executives, physicians, surgeons, architects, psychiatrists, psychologists, lawyers, and editors. When I first began working with artists, the majority of my clients lived in the New York City area. However, today, through phone consultations I help artists nationwide, as well as those who live in Canada, Europe, Japan, and South America. I also meet with many artists in person in Sarasota, Florida. I have advised and assisted artists in developing such basic career tools as r�sum�s, artist statements, biographies, and brochures. I have provided information and advice on exhibition, performance, and commission opportunities. I have advised and assisted in the preparation of exhibition proposals, book proposals, and grant proposals, and public relations campaigns. I have advised artists on how to negotiate with art dealers and to prepare for studio visits. I have also counseled artists on complex and seemingly less tangible career problems such as developing goals and helping artists learn to see themselves in relation to the world at large and as participants in the specific world of art and its various components. I have also counseled artists on handling rejection as well as success and on maintaining momentum and overcoming inertia. However, the most significant aspect of my work is helping artists to take control of their careers. Calling myself an artists` consultant and "hanging out a shingle" was not an easy task. For valid and comprehensible reasons, deeprooted skepticism was intrinsic to all arts communities. Initially, it was difficult to reach artists and convince them that what I had to say and offer was worthwhile. I jumped this major hurdle when a writer from the Village Voice wrote an article about me and why my services were needed and necessary. It was only one journalist`s opinion, but the endorsement was set in type, and I was deemed legitimate! Literally an hour after the Voice article hit the newsstands my life changed drastically. I was swamped with phone calls from artists eager to set up appointments. Nevertheless, after more than thirty years of counseling artists, I still find it is not uncommon to be questioned about why I am qualified to give artists advice. Some of my specific accomplishments are sprinkled throughout this book, cited to make or emphasize a point or convey an experience. Although I am no longer doing artwork, I have always been proud that I was able to live solely off my earnings as an artist. I exhibited at museums and cultural institutions throughout the United States and in Europe. I established a solid track record for winning grants and corporate contributions. I developed and implemented all of my own public relations and publicity. And I was regularly published in newspapers and periodicals. Managing my own career was something that no one person taught me. I learned from several individuals, positive and negative encounters, trial-and-error experiences, and personal intuition. My father was an artist and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. He earned a living as a graphic designer for the U.S. government. Early in his career he also worked as a freelance political cartoonist. In the evenings and on weekends he would design all sorts of "products"&#x2014;ranging from a line of greeting cards with rather offbeat messages to T-shirts and other paraphernalia with messages that espoused his political point of view. Although he was jubilant about each and every project and would go as far as having everything printed without a marketing plan, he "froze" when it came time to make business contacts and organize sales. Some of the cards and T-shirts were distributed free of charge to friends and relatives, but basically our basement became a huge repository for what might have been. When he retired, he started painting profusely. And although he read every word in each edition of my book, he never asked me for advice on how to get his watercolors beyond the walls of his house nor did I ever hear him mention that he submitted his work for exhibition consideration. Only in recent years did I finally make the connection between the work I do with artists and my family background&#x2014;that I am helping artists achieve what my father was unable to do: enter the marketplace. This book contains information and advice derived from all of my experiences when I was working as an artist, as well as those of my clients, and most certainly some subliminal messages that I received from my childhood and adolescent years. I have offered perceptions, observations, and advice that would have been invaluable to me when I first started to make a career as an artist. What artists need most is objective advice, but what they usually receive is reinforcement of a myth of what it is like to be an artist. All too often artists are characterized as underdogs, and accordingly this image is reinforced throughout their careers. I can`t promise that all of my advice is objective, since my personal experiences come into play, but the original incentive to write this book came from realizing how much underdog philosophy was being published under the guise of "nuts and bolts" career management. Much of the reading material published in the 1970s and 1980s flatly stated that the way the art world operates will always remain the same, and it is naive to try to change it. Other publications were more subtle, but the tone was patronizing: "Yes, artists, you might be creative, talented, and have a lot to give to the world, but there are `others` who really know what is going on, others who know best." A book published in 1970 used the sexist title The Artist`s Guide to His Market. Although the title of subsequent editions was changed to The Artist`s Guide to the Art Market, the author advised that it would be unrealistic for artists to believe that they can earn a living through art sales.1 Although, in the 2000s, books on career management for artists are more plentiful and some publications emit tones that are more optimistic and empowering, the attitudes displayed by artists and many members of the art world continue to reek of the master/slave and victim/victimizer mentality. This book addresses artists` roles in advancing and bettering their lot, taking control of their careers, learning to market their work, learning</p></p><h2>Favorite Catholic Latin Hymns</h2><p>This booklet contains a variety of traditional Catholic hymns in Latin.</p><p></p><h2>Why Size Matters: From Bacteria to Blue Whales</h2><p><p>John Tyler Bonner, one of our most distinguished and creative biologists, here offers a completely new perspective on the role of size in biology. In his hallmark friendly style, he explores the universal impact of being the right size. By examining stories ranging from Alice in Wonderland to Gulliver's Travels, he shows that humans have always been fascinated by things big and small. Why then does size always reside on the fringes of science and never on the center stage? Why do biologists and others ponder size only when studying something else--running speed, life span, or metabolism?</p><br><br><p> <i>Why Size Matters</i>, a pioneering book of big ideas in a compact size, gives size its due by presenting a profound yet lucid overview of what we know about its role in the living world. Bonner argues that size really does matter--that it is the supreme and universal determinant of what any organism can be and do. For example, because tiny creatures are subject primarily to forces of cohesion and larger beasts to gravity, a fly can easily walk up a wall, something we humans cannot even begin to imagine doing.</p><br><p> Bonner introduces us to size through the giants and dwarfs of human, animal, and plant history and then explores questions including the physics of size as it affects biology, the evolution of size over geological time, and the role of size in the function and longevity of living things.</p><br><p> As this elegantly written book shows, size affects life in its every aspect. It is a universal frame from which nothing escapes.</p></p><p><br><p>"John Tyler Bonner's career in biology has been long, happy, and just a little larger than life. For more than sixty years, the invisible world he explores through the microscope has led him to big ideas about the nature of things. This tiny book is their summation. As you read it, the light on the stage of the microscope expands and expands until virtually everything is illuminated. In fact, after reading Why Size Matters, you may conclude that this book is the one and only place where size does not matter."<b>--Jonathan Weiner, author of <i>The Beak of the Finch</i> and <i>His Brother's Keeper</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"John Tyler Bonner's latest book is a masterly summary of more than fifty years of thinking about why organisms are the size they are, and it is presented in the elegant prose we have come to expect from him. The theme is lucidly set out, developed using clear examples, and illustrated with drawings and graphs that enhance the text and his explanations of topics."<b>--Brian K. Hall, Dalhousie University</b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Why Size Matters</i> has the usual spontaneity and insight of a book by John Tyler Bonner. It is full of interesting facts and ideas, and is fun to read-the next best thing to a conversation with the author himself. Bonner approaches the complex subject of size in biology with unabashed enthusiasm. He combines a literary flair with scientific sophistication to explain why dimension and scale so profoundly affect individual behavior and organic evolution."<b>--Mary Jane West-Eberhard, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute</b><br></p><br><b>John Tyler Bonner</b> is professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University.

The only survivors are the young son of a media mogul and an obscure painter who, given his less than elevated status, seems like a wild card from the start. What happened on that flight? Why did the plane go down and if it was intentional, who was the target? With each chapter of <em>Before the Fall</em>, Hawley peels back another layer of the lives of those onboard that fatal flight meanwhile, the media speculation and accusations in the days after the crash threaten to overwhelm truth and decency. The end is surprising, even a little bit of a &#x201c;huh.&#x201d; moment at first, but it&#x2019;s an ending that sinks in and starts the wheels turning on everything that came before it, which, to me, is the hallmark of an unforgettable story. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em>Noah Hawley is the author of three previous novels, including The Punch and A Conspiracy of Tall Men.

As the defiant but sensitive young genius is creating his theory of relativity, a new conception of time, he imagines many possible worlds. In one, time is circular, so that people are fated to repeat triumphs and failures over and over. In another, there is a place where time stands still, visited by lovers and parents clinging to their children. In another, time is a nightingale, sometimes trapped by a bell jar.<br><br>Now translated into thirty languages, <b>Einstein&#x2019;s Dreams</b> has inspired playwrights, dancers, musicians, and painters all over the world. In poetic vignettes, it explores the connections between science and art, the process of creativity, and ultimately the fragility of human existence.</p><p>If you liked the eerie whimsy of Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>, Steven Millhauser's <i>Little Kingdoms</i>, or Jorge Luis Borges's <i>Labyrinths</i>, you will love Alan Lightman's ethereal yet down-to-earth book <i>Einstein's Dreams</i>. Lightman teaches physics and writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helping bridge the light-year-size gap between science and the humanities, the enemy camps C.P. Snow famously called <i>The Two Cultures</i>.<p> <i>Einstein's Dreams</i> became a bestseller by delighting both scientists and humanists. It is technically a novel. Lightman uses simple, lyrical, and literal details to locate Einstein precisely in a place and time--Berne, Switzerland, spring 1905, when he was a patent clerk privately working on his bizarre, unheard-of theory of relativity. The town he perceives is vividly described, but the waking Einstein is a bit player in this drama.</p><p> The book takes flight when Einstein takes to his bed and we share his dreams, 30 little fables about places where time behaves quite differently. In one world, time is circular; in another a man is occasionally plucked from the present and deposited in the past: "He is agonized. For if he makes the slightest alteration in anything, he may destroy the future ... he is forced to witness events without being part of them ... an inert gas, a ghost ... an exile of time." The dreams in which time flows backward are far more sophisticated than the time-tripping scenes in Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, though science-fiction fans may yearn for a sustained yarn, which Lightman declines to provide. His purpose is simply to study the different kinds of time in Einstein's mind, each with its own lucid consequences. In their tone and quiet logic, Lightman's fables come off like Bach variations played on an exquisite harpsichord. People live for one day or eternity, and they respond intelligibly to each unique set of circumstances. Raindrops hang in the air in a place of frozen time; in another place everyone knows one year in advance exactly when the world will end, and acts accordingly.</p><p> "Consider a world in which cause and effect are erratic," writes Lightman. "Scientists turn reckless and mutter like gamblers who cannot stop betting.... In this world, artists are joyous." In another dream, time slows with altitude, causing rich folks to build stilt homes on mountaintops, seeking eternal youth and scorning the swiftly aging poor folk below. Forgetting eventually how they got there and why they subsist on "all but the most gossamer food," the higher-ups at length "become thin like the air, bony, old before their time."</p><p> There is no plot in this small volume--it's more like a poetry collection than a novel. Like Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i>, it's a mind-stretching meditation by a scientist who's been to the far edge of physics and is back with wilder tales than Marco Polo's. And unlike many admirers of Hawking, readers of <i>Einstein's Dreams</i> have a high probability of actually finishing it.</p>A modern classic, Einstein's Dreams is a fictional collage of stories dreamed by Albert Einstein in 1905, when he worked in a patent office in Switzerland.

Mr. Phelps spent over 40 years in and around Wall Street and the world of investing. His activities included being a private investor, columnist, analyst, author and financial advisor. His career spanned from just before the Crash of 1929 to the 70&#39;s. In spite of the the rather glamorous title, the book is actually about Buy and Hold investing. Yes, it is true that you could have made a million dollars by buying any of about 350 stocks he mentions if you had bought $10,000 worth and just sat back and watched it grow over time! Doesn&#39;t sound that exciting, does it? However, I hope you didn&#39;t miss the point that he mentions AT LEAST 350 opportunities to have done this! Most of the companies&#39; names will be quite familiar to most readers. With the histories of many of these companies available, Mr. Phelps goes back in time to examine what it was about these companies that made their potential as great as it was. How can one begin to see what it takes for a company to do well? Well enough to drive its stock from $1.00 to $100.00 over a period of time? This is the heart of Mr. Phelps&#39; book. He comes up with common characteristics that show up in many of the stocks he uses as examples. Now, what about his strategy of stock ownership? He says that the best way to preserve the wealth you accumulate from investing is to NOT SELL your stocks! Uncle Sam always wants a piece of the pie when you decide to cut it! Mr. Phelps says that no matter how long it takes, it&#39;s better to pass on stocks to your heirs than it is to sell them too soon!!

As people live longer lives, today&#x2019;s great demotions of older people cut deeper into their self-worth and human relations, beyond the reach of law or public policy. In <i>Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People</i>, award-winning writer and cultural critic Margaret Morganroth Gullette confronts the offenders: the ways people aging past midlife are portrayed in the media, by adult offspring; the esthetics and politics of representation in photography, film, and theater; and the incitement to commit suicide for those with early signs of &#x201c;dementia.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this original and important book, Gullette presents evidence of pervasive age-related assaults in contemporary societies&nbsp;and their chronic affects. The sudden onset of age-related shaming can occur anywhere&#x2014;the shove in the street, the cold shoulder at the party, the deaf ear at the meeting,&nbsp;the shut-out by the personnel office or the obtuseness of a government. Turning intimate suffering into public grievances, <i>Ending Ageism, Or How Not to Shoot Old People</i> effectively and beautifully argues that overcoming ageism is the next imperative social movement of our time.<p><i>About the cover image:</i></p><p>This elegant, dignified figure--Leda Machado, a Cuban old enough to have seen the Revolution--once the center of a vast photo mural, is now a fragment on a ruined wall. &nbsp;Ageism&nbsp;tears down the structures that all humans need to age well; to end it,&nbsp;a symbol of resilience offers us all brisk blue-sky energy.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Leda Antonia Machado&#x201d; from &#x201c;Wrinkles of the City, 2012.&#x201d;<br> Piotr Trybalski / Trybalski.com.

Her most recent book, <i>Agewise</i>, won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Award. She has been published widely in major media, including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Al Jazeera</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Ms.</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> online, <i>Boston Globe</i>, <i>Dissent</i>, <i>AlterNet</i>, <i>Forward</i>, and <i>Tikkun</i>. A recipient of NEH, ACLS, and Bunting Fellowships, she is a resident scholar at the Brandeis Women&#x2019;s Studies Research Center in Waltham, Massachusetts.<br> &nbsp;"In her stirring new book, the pioneering US writer Margaret Morganroth Gullette argues that the meaning of the word burden has shifted from referring to the demanding work of care-giving (expressing empathy with the carer) on to the recipient of care. No wonder so many older people worry that they&#x2019;ll become burdensome, and elder abuse is becoming so common." (<i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>"As one of the world's leading authorities on ageing and ageism, any new book from Margaret Gullette is always exciting. Here she highlights the emotional wisdom and moral imagination of old age, so very different from the narrow, demeaning public rhetorics of ageing. An essential book for our times."<br> &nbsp; (Lynne Segal <i>author of Out of Time: The Pleasures &amp; Perils of Ageing</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Margaret Morganroth Gullette is one of the shining lights of age studies. For decades she has been sweeping her bright searchlight across the landscape of American social, political and popular culture to identify and analyze ageism wherever it lurks.&#x201d; (Alix Kates Shulman <i>author of Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen and M�nage</i>)<br><br>"Margaret Morganroth Gullette's take-no-prisoners book is as scathing as its subtitle, which refers both to cameras (the power of portrayal) and to guns (the very real risks of growing old in an ageist world). Wide-ranging and erudite, <i>Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People</i>&nbsp;frames the struggle for age equity in the most human and compelling of terms."<br> &nbsp; (Ashton Applewhite <i>author of This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism</i>)<br><br>"In this bracing, wide-ranging new book by a pioneer of ageing studies, every page sparkles with fresh insight and burns with apt indignation at how the 'othering'&nbsp;of older people operates. Gullette exhorts us to reclaim public space and defiantly shows us how. Wonderful!"<br> &nbsp; (Anne Karpf <i>author of How to Age</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For baby-boomers (like me) this is a sobering, but also an inspiring book. <i>Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People</i> provides a fully developed cultural analysis, anatomizing the established habits of mind, institutional structures, and economic pressures that work to belittle and marginalize older people. The critique cuts deep, drawing together an extraordinary range of evidence from visual culture, media, social history, and literature. But Margaret Morganroth Gullette give us more than a jeremiad. Hers is a positive vision, offering many specific proposals for a movement of resistance that could encourage an epistemic shift &#x2013; a new conception of life&#x2019;s course, a fresh understanding of words like &#x2018;age,&#x2019; &#x2018;youth,&#x2019; &#x2018;decline,&#x2019; and much more. This is a profoundly engaged, urgent work of the humanist imagination.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (James Clifford <i>author of Returns: Becoming Indigenous in the Twenty-First Century</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People</i> penetrates far more deeply than the stock tropes about the affronts of age bias. With rich complexity Margaret Morganroth Gullette exposes ageism in many of its unusual manifestations, such as in her unusual and penetrating discussion of older farmers and world ecology.&nbsp; We too easily accept aging as a burden-in-waiting, rather than as the boon of longevity our added years can be both for individuals and global society.&#x201d; (Paul Kleyman <i>Director, Ethnic Elders Newsbeat, New America Media</i>)<br><br>"Gullette&#x2019;s many film references demonstrate her gravity as a film plus age critic and her opinion is worth seeking out" (Erin Trahan <i>The ARTery</i>)<br><br>"In her books, and perhaps most sharply in this new one,&nbsp;<i>Ending Ageism</i>, Gullette awakens her readers to the ideology of ageism" (Robert Mundle <i>RobertMundle.com</i>)<br><br>"Margaret Morganroth Gullette wants you to know she means the title of her new book,&nbsp;<i>Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People</i>, as a wake-up slap. She calls on Americans to be more aware of how the underlying age-based prejudice damages the lives of older people and their families&#x2014;while often placing ethnic elders and older women in double jeopardy of discrimination, adding a touch of gray to sexism and racism they may already endure."

His gray knee breeches and white stockings were of the finest silk, but the latter were wrinkled and he had long before kicked off his shoes. His long-tailed evening coat, which had molded his frame like a second skin when he had donned it earlier in the evening, had now been discarded and tossed carelessly onto another chair.<br><br>His finely embroidered waistcoat was unbuttoned. His neck cloth, on the arrangement of which his valet had spent longer than half an hour of loving artistry, had been pulled open and hung unsymmetrically against his left shoulder. His dark hair, expertly cut to look fashionably disheveled, now looked unfashionably untidy from having had his fingers pass through it one too many times. His eyes were half-closed&#x2014;and somewhat bloodshot. An empty glass dangled from one hand over the arm of the chair.<br><br>Julian Dare, Viscount Folingsby, was indisputably foxed.<br><br>He was also scowling. Drinking to excess was not among his usual vices. Gaming was. So was womanizing. And so was reckless living. But not drinking. He had always been careful to exclude from habit anything that might prove to also be addictive. He had every intention of one day "settling down," as his father phrased it, of being done with his "wild oats," another of the Earl of Grantham's clich�s. It would be just too inconvenient to have to deal with an addiction when the time came. Gambling was not an addiction with him. Neither were women. Though he was exceedingly fond of both.<br><br>He yawned and wondered what time it was. Daylight had not yet dawned, a small comfort when this was December and daylight did not deign to show itself until well on into the morning. Certainly it was well past midnight. <i>Well </i>past. He had left his sister's soir�e before midnight, but since then he had been to White's club and to one or two&#x2014;was it one or two?&#x2014;card parties at which the play had been deep and the drinking deeper.<br><br>He should get himself up from his chair and go to bed, but he did not have the energy. He should ring for his valet, then, and have the man drag him off to bed. But he did not have even the energy to get up and ring the bell. Doubtless he would not sleep anyway. He knew from experience that when he was three sheets to the wind, an approximately vertical position was preferable to a horizontal one.<br><br>Why the devil had he drunk so deep?<br><br>But drunkenness had not brought oblivion. He remembered very well why. That heiress. Miss Plunkett. No, <i>Lady </i>Sarah Plunkett. What a name! And unfortunately the chit had the face and disposition to match it. She was going to be at Conway for Christmas with her mama and papa. Emma, his youngest sister, had mentioned the fact in the letter that had reached him this morning&#x2014;no, yesterday morning. He had put two and two together without further ado and had come up with the inevitable total of four. But he had not needed to use any arithmetical or deductive skills.<br><br>His father's letter, which he had read next, had been far more explicit. Not only were the Plunkett chit and the Plunkett parents to join their family gathering for Christmas, but also Julian would oblige his father by paying court to the girl and fixing his interest with her. He was nine-and-twenty years old, after all, and had shown no sign of choosing anyone for himself. His father had been extremely patient with him. But it was high time he finished with his wild oats and settled down. As the only son among five sisters, three of them still unmarried and therefore still unsettled, it was his duty....<br><br>Viscount Folingsby passed the fingers of his free hand through his hair again, unconsciously restoring it almost to simple dishevelment, and eyed the brandy decanter a short distance away. An impossible distance away.<br><br>He was not going to do it&#x2014;marry the girl, that was.<br><br>It was as simple as that. No one could make him, not even his stern but annoyingly affectionate father. Not even his fond mama and doting sisters. He grimaced. Why had he been blessed with a singularly close and loving family? And why had his mother produced nothing but daughters after the initial triumph of his birth as heir to an earldom and vast properties and fortune&#x2014;almost every last half penny of which was entailed and would pass to a rather distant cousin if he failed to produce at least one heir of his own?<br><br>His lordship eyed the brandy decanter again with some determination, but he could not somehow force resolution downward far enough to set his legs in motion.<br><br>There had been another letter in the morning's post. From Bertie. Bertrand Hollander had been his close friend and coconspirator all through school and university. They were still close even though Bertie spent most of his time now overseeing his estates in the north of England. But Bertie had a hunting box in Norfolk-shire and a mistress in Yorkshire and intended to introduce the two to each other over Christmas. He was avoiding his own family with the excuse that he was going to go shooting with friends over the holiday. He intended instead to spend a week with his Debbie away from prying eyes and the need for propriety. He wanted Julian to join him there with his own mistress.<br><br>Julian did not currently have a resident mistress. He had dismissed the last one several months before on the grounds that evenings spent in her company had become even more predictable and every bit as tedious as evenings spent at the insipid weekly balls at Almack's. Since then he had had a mutually satisfactory arrangement with a widow of his acquaintance. But she was a respectable woman of good ton, hardly the sort he might invite to spend a cozy week of sin in Nor-folkshire with Bertie and his Debbie.<br><br>Damn! He was more foxed than he knew, Julian thought suddenly. He had gone somewhere tonight even before attending Elinor's soir�e. He had gone to the opera. Not that he was particularly fond of music&#x2014;not opera at least. He had gone to see the subject of the newest male gossip at White's. There was a new dancer of considerable charms, so it was said. But in the few weeks since she had made her first onstage appearance, she had not also made her first appearance in any of the beds of those who had attempted to entice her there. She was either waiting for the highest bidder or she was waiting for someone she fancied or she was a virtuous woman.<br><br>Julian, his father's summons and Bertie's invitation fresh in his mind, had gone to the opera to see what the fuss was all about.<br><br>The fuss was all about long, shapely legs, a slender, lithe body and long titian hair. Not red, nothing so vulgar. Titian. And emerald eyes. Not that he had been able to see their color from the box he had occupied during the performance. But he had seen it through his quizzing glass as he had stood in the doorway of the greenroom afterward.<br><br>Miss Blanche Heyward had been surrounded by a court of appropriately languishing admirers. His lordship had looked her over unhurriedly through his glass and inclined his head to her when her eyes had met his across the room. And then he had joined the even larger crowd of gentlemen gathered about Hannah Dove, the singer who sang like her name, or so one of her court had assured her. For which piece of gross flattery he had been rewarded with a gracious smile and a hand to kiss.<br><br>Julian had left the greenroom after a few minutes and taken himself off to his married sister's drawing room.<br><br>It might be interesting to try his own hand at assaulting the citadel of dubious virtue that was Blanche Heyward. It might be even more interesting to carry her off to Bertie's for Christmas and a weeklong hot affair. If he went to Conway, all he would have was the usual crowded, noisy, enjoyable Christmas, and the Plunkett chit. If he went to Norfolkshire...<br><br>Well, the mind boggled.<br><br>What he <i>could </i>do, he decided, was make her decision his, too. He would ask her. If she said yes, then he would go to Norfolkshire. For a final fling. As a swan song to freedom and wild oats and all the rest of it. In the spring, when the season brought the fashionable world to town, the Plunkett girl among them, he would do his duty. He would have her big with child by <i>next </i>Christmas. The very thought had him holding his aching head with the hand that had been holding his glass a minute before. What the devil had he done with it? Dropped it? Had there been any brandy left in it? Couldn't have been or he would have drunk it instead of sitting here conspiring how he might reach the decanter, on legs that refused to obey his brain.<br><br>If she said no&#x2014;Blanche, that was, not the heiress&#x2014; then he would go down to Conway and embrace his fate. That way he would probably have a child <i>in the nursery </i>by next Christmas.<br><br>Julian lowered his hand from his head to his throat with the intention of loosening his neck cloth. But someone had already done it for him.<br><br>Dammit, but she was gorgeous. Not the heiress. Who the devil was gorgeous, then? Someone he had met at Elinor's?<br><br>There was a quiet scratching at the sitting room door, and it opened to reveal the cautious, respectful face of his lordship's valet.<br><br>"About time," Julian told him. "Someone took all the bones out of my legs when I was not looking. Deuced inconvenient."<br><br>"Yes, my lord," his man said, coming purposefully toward him. "You will be wishing someone took them from your head before many more hours have passed. Come along then, sir. Put your arm about my neck."<br><br>"Deuced impertinence," his lordship muttered. "Remind me to dismiss you when I am sober."<br><br>"Yes, my lord," the valet said cheerfully.<br><br>Several hours before Viscount Folingsby found himself sprawled before the fire in his sitting room with boneless legs and aching head, Miss Verity Ewing let herself into a darkened house on an unfashionable street in London, using her latchkey and a considerable amount of stealth. She had no wish to waken anyone. She would tiptoe upstairs without lighting a candle, she decided, careful to avoid the eighth stair, which creaked. She would undress in the darkness and hope not to disturb Chastity. Her sister was, unfortunately, a light sleeper.<br><br>But luck was against her. Before she could so much as set foot on the bottom stair, the door to the downstairs living room opened and a shaft of candlelight beamed out into the hall.<br><br>"Verity?"<br><br>"Yes, Mama." Verity sighed inwardly even as she put a cheerful smile on her face. "You ought not to have waited up."<br><br>"I could not sleep," her mother told her as Verity followed her into the sitting room. She set down the candle and pulled her shawl more closely about her shoulders. There was no fire burning in the hearth. "You know I worry until you come home."<br><br>"Lady Coleman was invited to a late supper after the opera," Verity explained, "and wanted me to accompany her."<br><br>"It was very inconsiderate of her, I am sure," Mrs. Ewing said rather plaintively. "It is thoughtless to keep a gentleman's daughter out late almost every night of the week and send her home in a hackney cab instead of in her ladyship's own carriage."<br><br>"It is kind of her even to hire the hackney," Verity said. "But it is chilly and you are cold." She did not need to ask why there was no fire. A fire after ten o'clock at night was an impossible extravagance in their household. "Let us go up to bed. How was Chastity this evening?"<br><br>"She did not cough above three or four times all evening," Mrs. Ewing said. "And not once did she have a prolonged bout. The new medicine seems really to be working."<br><br>"I hoped it would." Verity smiled and picked up the candle. "Come, Mama."<br><br>But she could not entirely avoid the usual questions about the opera, what Lady Coleman had worn, who else had made up their party, who had invited them for supper, what they had eaten, what topics of conversation had been pursued. Verity answered as briefly as she could, though she did, for her mother's sake, give a detailed description of the costly and fashionable gown her employer had worn.<br><br>"All I can say," Mrs. Ewing said in a hushed voice as they stood outside the door of her bedchamber, "is that Lady Coleman is a strange sort of lady, Verity. Most ladies hire companions to live in and run and fetch for them during the day when time hangs heavy on their hands. They do not allow them to live at home, and they do not require their services mostly during the evenings when they go out into society."<br><br>"How fortunate I am to have discovered such a lady, then," Verity said, "and to have won her approval. I could not bear to have to live in and see you and Chastity only on half days off. Lady Coleman is a widow, Mama, and needs company for respectability when she goes out. I could scarcely ask for more pleasant employment. It pays reasonably well, too, and will get better. Only this evening Lady Coleman declared that she is pleased with me and is considering raising my salary quite substantially."<br><br>But her mother did not look as pleased as Verity had hoped. She shook her head as she took the candle. "Ah, my love," she said, "I never thought to see the day when a daughter of mine would have to seek employment. The Reverend Ewing, your papa, left us little, it is true, but we might have scraped by quite comfortably if it had not been for Chastity's illness. And if General Sir Hector Ewing were not unfortunately in Vienna for the peace talks, he would have helped us, I am certain. You and Chastity are his own brother's children, after all."<br><br>"Pray do not vex yourself, Mama." Verity kissed her mother's cheek. "We are together, the three of us, and Chastity is recovering her health after seeing a reputable physician and being prescribed the right medicine. Really, those are the only things that matter.

This was what Sylvie Serfer Woodruff thought as the elevator descended from the sixth floor and opened onto the gleaming expanse of the lobby of the Four Seasons in Philadelphia. After thirty-two years of marriage, fourteen of them as the wife of the senior senator from New York, after visits to six continents and some of the major cities of the world, perhaps she should have been able to come up with something more profound about human nature and common ground and the ties that bind us all, but there it was&#x2014;her very own insight. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t much, but it wasn&#x2019;t nothing. If pressed, Sylvie also had some very profound and trenchant observations to make about executive airport lounges.<br> <br>She took a deep breath, uncomfortably aware of the way the waistband of her skirt dug into her midriff. Then she slipped her hand into her husband&#x2019;s and walked beside him, past the reception desk toward the restaurant, thinking that it was a good thing, a reassuring thing, that no matter where you were, London or Los Angeles or Dubai, if you were in a good hotel, a Four Seasons or a Ritz-Carlton&#x2014;and, these days, when she and Richard traveled they were almost always in a Four Seasons or a Ritz-Carlton&#x2014;your breakfast would never surprise you.<br> <br>There would be menus, offered today by a girl in a trim black suit who stood behind a podium in the plushly carpeted entryway, beaming at the patrons as if their arrival represented the very pinnacle of her day and possibly of her lifetime. Richard would wave the menus away. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do the buffet,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d announce, without asking whether there was one. There always was. &#x201c;Of course, sir,&#x201d; their waiter or the maitre d&#x2019; or today&#x2019;s black-suited girl would murmur in approval. They&#x2019;d be led through a richly appointed room, past the heavy silk drapes, elaborately tassled and tied, past mahogany sideboards and expensively dressed diners murmuring over their coffee. Richard would deposit his briefcase and his newspapers at their table, and then they&#x2019;d proceed to the buffet.<br> <br>There&#x2019;d be an assortment of fresh fruit, slices of melon, peeled segments of grapefruit and orange and sliced kiwis, arranged like jewels on white china platters. There were always croissants, chocolate and plain, always muffins, bran and blueberry and corn, always bagels (yes, even in Dubai), always shot glasses layered with yogurt and muesli, always slices of bread and English muffins, arrayed next to a toaster, and chafing dishes of scrambled eggs and bacon and sausage and breakfast potatoes, and there was always a chef in a toque and a white jacket, making omelets. Richard would ask for an omelet (spinach, as a nod to health, and mushrooms and Cheddar cheese&#x2014;he liked onions, but couldn&#x2019;t risk a day of bad breath). Once the order was placed, he&#x2019;d hand off his plate to Sylvie and return to their table, to his New York Times and his Wall Street Journal and the eternal consolation of his BlackBerry, and Sylvie would wait for his food.<br> <br>The first time her mother, the Honorable Selma Serfer, had seen Sylvie perform this maneuver, she&#x2019;d stared at her daughter with her mouth open and a dot of Crimson Kiss lipstick staining her incisor. &#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked, in her grating Brooklyn accent. Sylvie had tried to shush her. Selma, as always, had refused to be shushed. &#x201c;Seriously, Sylvie? This is what you do? You fetch his eggs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s busy,&#x201d; Sylvie murmured, shifting the plate to her right hand and tucking a lock of hair behind her ear with her left. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; She knew what her mother was thinking without the Honorable Selma, first in her class (and one of seven women) at Yale Law, former chief judge of the state of New York, having to say a word. Sylvie should mind, and Sylvie should be busy, too. Like her mother, Sylvie had gone to Barnard and Yale. Sylvie was meant to have followed in Selma&#x2019;s footsteps straight up to the Supreme Court, or at the very least practiced law for more than two years. Selma and David Serfer&#x2019;s only child had been intended for better things than marriage, motherhood, committee work for various charities, and collecting her husband&#x2019;s breakfast.<br> <br>Ah, well, she thought, as the chef swirled melted butter in a pan. She was happy with her life, even if it didn&#x2019;t please her mother. She loved her husband, she respected what he&#x2019;d accomplished, she felt good about the part that she&#x2019;d played in his career. Besides, she knew it could be worse. In cities all over the world, women went hungry, were beaten or abused; women watched their children suffer. Sylvie had seen them, had touched their hands and bounced their babies on her lap. It seemed churlish to complain about the occasional small indignity, about the hours she&#x2019;d spent campaigning, face smoothed into a pleasant expression, mouth set in a smile, hair straightened into an inoffensive shoulder-length bob, wearing hose that squeezed her middle and pumps that pinched her toes, standing behind her husband, saying nothing.<br> <br>Normally, it didn&#x2019;t bother her, but every so often, discontent rose up inside her, spurred by some unpleasant reminder of her unrealized potential. A few months ago, the forms for her thirty-fifth reunion at Barnard had arrived in her in-box. There&#x2019;d been a survey, a series of questions about life after college. One of them was Tell us how you spend your time. If you&#x2019;re working, please describe your job. Before she could stop herself, Sylvie had typed My job is to stay on a diet so that I can fit into size-six St. John knit suits and none of the bloggers can say that my behind&#x2019;s getting big. She&#x2019;d erased the words immediately, replacing them with a paragraph about her volunteer work, the funds she raised for the homeless and the ballet, breast cancer research and the library and the Museum of Modern Art. She&#x2019;d added a sentence about her daughters: Diana, who was an emergency-room doctor right here in Philadelphia, and Lizzie, vexing Lizzie who&#x2019;d given them such heartache, now several months sober (she didn&#x2019;t mention that), with her hair restored to its original blond and all those horrible piercings practically closed. She&#x2019;d added a final beat about how for the last fourteen years she had been lucky enough to travel the world in the company of her husband, Senator Richard Woodruff, D-NY. But sometimes, late at night, she thought that the truth was the first thing she&#x2019;d written. Whatever ambition she&#x2019;d possessed, whatever the dreams she&#x2019;d once had, Sylvie Serfer Woodruff had grown up to be a fifty-seven-year-old professional dieter, a woman whose only real job now that her daughters were gone was staying twenty pounds thinner than she&#x2019;d been in law school.<br> <br>So she&#x2019;d lost herself a little bit, she thought, as the chef sprinkled cheese into the pan. So life hadn&#x2019;t been perfect; bad things had happened, mistakes had been made. But hadn&#x2019;t they built something together, she and Richard, and Lizzie and Diana, and wasn&#x2019;t that more important, more meaningful, than anything Sylvie could have done on her own? What kind of career would she have had, anyhow? She wasn&#x2019;t as good a lawyer as her mother. She might have been quick, and smart and well-read, but her mind wasn&#x2019;t built to spring and snap shut like a trap the way her mother&#x2019;s was. She could admit, if only to herself, that she was bright but not terribly ambitious; that she lacked a certain something, aggression or tenacity or even just desire, that magical quality that would have lifted her from good to great. But she&#x2019;d found a place for herself in the world. She&#x2019;d raised her girls and been a help to her husband, a sounding board and a concierge, a scheduler and a speechwriter, a traveling companion and a co-campaigner. So what if every once in a while late at night she felt like all she had to show for her years on the planet were miles logged on a treadmill that took her nowhere and a number on the scale that was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain? So what if...<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; The chef was staring at her, spatula raised. The omelet sat in a perfectly browned half-circle in the center of the pan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said, and held out the empty plate toward him like an orphan in a Dickens novel, an orphan asking for more.<br> <br>He slid the omelet onto the plate. Sylvie collected the slices of whole-wheat bread she&#x2019;d popped into the toaster. She added a pat of butter, a pot of marmalade, the wedges of cantaloupe that Richard would ignore, and a single slice of bacon, well-done, the way he preferred it (he&#x2019;d want more than one slice, but there was his heart to consider). Richard was reading the Op-Ed page and talking on his phone, with a cup of coffee steaming at his elbow, so busy multitasking that he barely looked up. She set his food in front of him and tapped his shoulder. &#x201c;Eat,&#x201d; she said, and Richard smiled, put his arm around her waist, and gave her a quick squeeze.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, dear,&#x201d; he said, and she said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; then went back to gather her own joyless meal: fat-free yogurt, a single stewed prune, a mini-box of Special K, a glass of skim milk, and, as her reward, a scoop of the oatmeal she could never resist, deliciously creamy, the way it never got at home. She&#x2019;d add a little butter, a swirl of brown sugar, a splash of cream, turning it into something that was more like pudding than breakfast.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d eaten only a few bites when Richard dropped his crumpled napkin over the remains of his eggs. He&#x2019;d ignored the fruit, as she predicted, and the bacon was gone, the way she knew it would be. &#x201c;All set?&#x201d; he asked. She wasn&#x2019;t. But she nodded, rising as he stood, gripping the starchy elbows of his suit jacket as he kissed her, lightly, on the lips. Her schedule was in a manila folder, tucked into her purse, and had been beamed to her iPhone as a backup, along with her speech. Richard would be attending a fund-raising coffee for a state senator, a rising star in the party who was being groomed for bigger things. This would be followed by a lunch at the convention center with CEOs of some of the nation&#x2019;s largest hospitals, bigwigs looking for breaks on the import taxes they&#x2019;d pay to have their MRI machines assembled in Japan. Meanwhile, Sylvie, who hated public speaking, would be locking her shaking knees, hiding her sweating palms, and delivering an address to the Colonial Dames, a Philadelphia variation of the Junior League, about how, if each of them gave just what she spent each month on highlights and lattes to the Free Library, they could buy hundreds of books and expose thousands of children to the joys of stories. It was a speech she&#x2019;d given dozens of times and would doubtless give dozens of times more before her husband&#x2019;s third term ended in four years. And after that? &#x201c;Sky&#x2019;s the limit,&#x201d; Richard used to say, when they were young and dreaming, lying on the flimsy mattress in their apartment on Court Street in Brooklyn, where the floors tilted so severely that if you put anything round down against one wall it would roll to the other side of the room.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d lived in Brooklyn back when telling people your address made them treat you with the solicitous courtesy they&#x2019;d extend to pioneers who&#x2019;d just set off west in a covered wagon. Back then, Richard owned two suits, one navy blue and one brown, both purchased at an end-of-season clearance sale at Bloomingdale&#x2019;s and paid for, in part, with a gift certificate that Sylvie&#x2019;s parents had given her for Chanukah to buy her own working-girl wardrobe. He would rotate his suits Monday through Friday&#x2014;blue, brown, blue, brown, blue&#x2014;and on Saturdays, he&#x2019;d drop them off at the cleaner&#x2019;s. Every morning they&#x2019;d walk to the subway together, and Sylvie would follow him down the stairs, thinking how lucky she was to have found this man, her Richard&#x2014;slim-hipped, broad-shouldered, his light-brown hair thick and unruly, no matter how carefully he combed it, the hair of a little boy who&#x2019;d just rolled out of bed, with his briefcase swinging jauntily in one hand. That&#x2019;s my husband, she would think. She&#x2019;d want to shout it to the sky, or at least to the other women she&#x2019;d catch looking him over, their eyes making the drop from his face to his ring finger. My husband. Mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Husband,&#x201d; she whispered, standing on her tiptoes (Richard was nine inches taller than she was, a solid six foot three, a presidential height, she sometimes thought) and letting her lips graze his ear. Almost imperceptibly, he shuddered. &#x201c;Wife,&#x201d; he whispered back. Richard had always been ticklish. In bed, she&#x2019;d drag the tip of her tongue along the edge of his ear, nipping at the lobe with her teeth, and he&#x2019;d tremble, muttering her name. At least, he used to. Sylvie frowned, or attempted a frown&#x2014;the Botox she&#x2019;d gotten the week before was making it hard to furrow her brow&#x2014;and tried to remember how long it had been. Over the past months&#x2014;maybe even the past years&#x2014;things had slowed down, not in an alarming fashion, but in a manner that Sylvie had come to believe was normal for long-married couples. They made love once or twice a week, sometimes with dry spells of a week or two (or three, or four) when Congress was in session and Richard spent the weeknights in the rented townhouse in Georgetown. She missed it sometimes, but she thought that the kind of sex they&#x2019;d had at the beginning&#x2014;every night, sometimes twice a night, once in the thankfully empty sauna at a resort where they&#x2019;d gone for a law school classmate&#x2019;s wedding&#x2014;that was the sex you had in the early days, and then things settled down, they had to, or else how would anyone get any work done, or raise children?<br> <br>Richard gave her a squeeze and planted another kiss in the center of her paralyzed, poisonous brow (perfectly safe, the dermatologist had assured her when he&#x2019;d come to the apartment with his doctor&#x2019;s bag full of needles and his mouth full of reassurance). &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you tonight,&#x201d; he said. Sylvie watched him walk out of the restaurant, BlackBerry in one hand, briefcase in the other, through the lobby and then out to the curb, where a car would be waiting, the way, these days, a car always was. My husband, she thought, and her heart swelled, the way it had when she was a young bride watching Richard descend into the depths of the subway station, ready to rule the world.<br> <br>� &nbsp; � &nbsp; �<br> <br>She was in the backseat of her own Town Car by four o&#x2019;clock, an issue of The Economist open in her lap, reading the latest news from the Middle East as the car crawled through a five-mile backup on the New Jersey Turnpike. The region was clenched in a typical August heat wave, the air a humid steambath that left everyone sticky and ill-tempered after even the briefest venture outside. She was planning her movements, how she&#x2019;d exit the car and enter her apartment building with the least time possible spent in the humidity&#x2014;she had a cocktail party to attend, and she didn&#x2019;t want to have to redo her hair&#x2014;when her cell phone rang. Or, rather, her cell phone belched. Lizzie, her youngest, had set it up so it would burp instead of ring, and Sylvie hadn&#x2019;t been able to figure out how to make it stop. The phone burped again, and her best friend Ceil&#x2019;s face flashed on the screen. In the picture, which Sylvie had taken outside the Buttercup Bakery, Ceil was devouring a red velvet cupcake, and had a dab of frosting on her nose. Sylvie had snapped it and had threatened to post it on Facebook. Not that she completely understood how Facebook worked, or had any idea of how to post things there. The threat alone had been enough to make Ceil laugh. As she hit the button to answer the call, Sylvie noticed two missed calls, both from Richard. She&#x2019;d call him back after she was through with Ceil, she decided, and lifted the phone to her ear. &#x201c;Hi!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Ceil whispered. &#x201c;Ar...</p><h2>PRIMATES IN QUESTION (Smithsonian Answer Book)</h2><p>The mysterious and often unpredictable world of primates is explained by Smithsonian scientists in a Q&amp;A format. <p>A comprehensive response to the many thousands of calls and letters the Smithsonian receives regarding questions related to monkeys, apes, lemurs, tamarins, and their relatives.

Offenders repeat and return to jail. Chuck Colson shows why the prevailing systems of criminal justice simply don&#39;t work. The book showcases Colson at his best, including personal stories, historical study, and shocking statistics. Bottom line: only a system that is based on a biblical worldview, a system that restores both the offender and the offended, will have any lasting success. This authoritative work is Colson&#39;s legacy statement about criminal justice. These proven principles can reverse the current criminal decline.</p><p>Since his incarceration in the aftermath of Watergate, Charles Colson has consistently lived and worked for a singular purpose: To transform the hearts and minds of people in prison. For twenty-five years, he has been associated with justice reform. And still today he maintains a deep passion for those behind bars and their families. <p> Colson's personal experience, his study of the justice system and prison reform, and most of all his interactions with prisoners themselves all come together in this new, insightful, and prophetic new book, <i>Justice That Restores.</i> </p><p> America is at the crossroads, he argues, and lacks clear direction in which way to turn. All the utopian theories and ideologies have failed. We build more prisons, but crime increases, and more facilities are needed. Inequities and injustice in the system abound. America needs to do something. Now. </p><p> He writes, "The remedy to this crisis goes far beyond building more prisons, hiring more police, or writing tougher penalties into the law. Such measures, no matter how draconian, will have no effect on consciences or on the culture that trains consciences. Moral failures don't register on metal detectors, and other proposed panaceas such as eliminating poverty and racism, tighter gun controls, better education, or more therapy are nothing but palliatives for the crime problem." </p><p> What is the answer? </p><p> The answer is found in the lives of Leon and Danny and Don, whose stories are told here, as well as in the lives of thousands of other convicts who have changed fundamentally deep down inside themselves, not because of the government or the justice system, but because of a connection with someone who has helped bring about a spiritual change. It is not just a change of heart, but a change of soul. </p><p> Here lies the answer: <i>Justice That Restores.</i></p>Our criminal justice system urgently needs reform. <p> Rehabilitation hasn't worked.<br> Deterrence methods haven't worked.<br> It's time for justice that restores-- restores both the offender and the community shattered by crime. </p><p> In his legacy statement about criminal justice, Charles Colson-ex-offender and founder of the international Prison Fellowship Ministries-proposes a radical new paradigm for looking at the crisis in our criminal justice system. His remedy goes far beyond building more prisons, hiring more police, or writing tougher penalties into the law. Such measures, he says, will have no effect on consciences or on the culture that trains consciences. </p><p> Colson contends that a system of true justice can be built only if it is based on a foundation of sound worldview. What we believe as individuals about the value of life, the essence of human nature, and the possibility of redemption is the critical issue that determines an effective approach to justice and reform. </p><p> The key is changing the human heart, opening the way for forgiveness, reconciliation, and a new view of life. Not justice that rehabilitates, but justice that restores the soul.</p></p><h2>Tess of The D&#39;Urbervilles (Collins Classics)</h2><p>HarperCollins is pround to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Here is a tough-minded exploration of why we're in trouble, starting with the basic issues of who gets heard, who gets ignored, and why. Greider shows us the realities of power in Washington today, uncovering the hidden relationships that link politicians with corporations and the rich, and that subvert the needs of ordinary citizens. <br> How do we put meaning back into public life? Greider shares the stories of some citizens who have managed to crack Washington's "Grand Bazaar" of influence peddling as he reveals the structures designed to thwart them. Without naivet� or cynicism, Greider shows us how the system can still be made to work <i>for the people,</i> and delineates the lines of battle in the struggle to save democracy. By showing us the reality of how the political decisions that shape our lives are made, William Greider explains how we can begin to take control once more.</p><p><b>William Greider</b> is the bestselling author of five previous books, including <i>One World, Ready or Not</i> (on the global economy), <i>Who Will Tell the People</i> (on American politics), and <i>Secrets of the Temple</i> (on the Federal Reserve). A reporter for forty years, he has written for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i> and has been an on-air correspondent for six <i>Frontline</i> documentaries on PBS. Currently the national affairs correspondent for <i>The Nation,</i> he lives in Washington, D.C.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>MOCK DEMOCRACY</b><br><br>In a democracy, everyone is free to join the argument, or so it is said in civic mythology. In the modern democracy that has evolved, that claim is nearly meaningless. During the last generation, a "new politics" has enveloped government that guarantees the exclusion of most Americans from the debate -- the expensive politics of facts and information.<br><br>A major industry has grown up in Washington around what might be called "democracy for hire" -- business firms and outposts of sponsored scholars devoted to concocting facts and opinions and expert analysis, then aiming them at the government. That is the principal function of all those enterprises along Washington's main boulevards like K Street -- the public-relations agencies, the direct-mail companies and opinion-polling firms. All these work in concert with the infrastructure of think tanks, tax-exempt foundations and other centers that churn out reams of policy ideas for the political debate. Most are financed by corporate interests and wealthy benefactors. The work of lobbyists and lawyers involves delivering the material to the appropriate legislators and administrators.<br><br>Only those who have accumulated lots of money are free to play in this version of democracy. Only those with a strong, immediate financial stake in the political outcomes can afford to invest this kind of money in manipulating the governing decisions. Most Americans have neither the personal ability nor the wherewithal to compete on this field.<br><br>The contours of this barrier are embedded in the very texture of everyday political debate itself. Citizens have been incapacitated, quite literally, because they do not speak the language. Modern methodologies of persuasion have created a new hierarchy of influence over government decisions -- a new way in which organized money dominates the action while the unorganized voices of citizens are inhibited from speaking. A lonely congressman, trying to represent the larger public interest, finds himself arrayed against an army of authorities -- working for the other side.<br><br>Beyond the fact of unequal resources, however, lies a more troubling proposition: that democracy is now held captive by the mystique of "rational" policymaking, narrow assumptions about what constitutes legitimate political evidence. It is a barrier of privilege because it effectively discounts authentic political expressions from citizens and elevates the biases and opinions of the elites.<br><br>This mystique, not surprisingly, is embraced and exalted by well-educated citizens of most every persuasion, the people who are equipped with professional skills and expertise, including the dedicated reformers who attempt to speak for the larger public. After all, it is the basis for their own primacy in political action. Yet the premise of rationality, as the evidence demonstrates, is deeply flawed and routinely biased in its applications.<br><br>For those who are active every day in the conventional politics of governing, this proposition may not be so easy to grasp. Indeed, it will seem quite threatening to some of them, for it challenges their own deeply held beliefs about how politics is supposed to work and puts in question the meaning of their own political labors. Ordinary citizens, those who are distant from power, will have much less difficulty seeing the truth of the argument -- that information-driven politics has become a convenient reason to ignore them.<br><br>Jack Bonner, an intense young denizen of K Street, has the squirrelly enthusiasm of a salesman who can't stop talking about his product because he truly believes in it. What Bonner's firm sells is democracy, not the abstract version found in textbooks, but the living, breathing kind that occurs when people call up a senator and tell him how to vote. Bonner &amp; Associates packages democratic expression and sells it to corporate clients -- drug manufacturers and the cosmetic industry, insurance companies and cigarette makers and the major banks.<br><br>Jack Bonner's firm is an exotic but relatively small example of the vast information industry that now surrounds the legislative debate and government in general. You want facts to support the industry's lobbying claims? It pumps out facts. You want expert opinions from scholars? It has those in abundance from the think tanks corporate contributors underwrite. You want opinion polls? It hires polling firms to produce them. You want people -- live voters who support the industry position? Jack Bonner delivers them.<br><br>When the Senate was debating the new clean-air legislation in 1990, certain wavering senators received pleas from the grassroots on the question of controlling automobile pollution. The Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the Mahoning Valley wrote to Senator John Glenn of Ohio. Sam Nunn of Georgia heard from the Georgia Baptist Convention and its 1.2 million members. The Easter Seal Society of South Dakota lobbied Senator Thomas A. Daschle. The Delaware Paralyzed Veterans Association contacted Senator William V. Roth, Jr.<br><br>These groups and some others declared their opposition to the pending clean-air amendment that would compel the auto industry to improve the average fuel efficiency of its cars substantially. The measure would both conserve energy and reduce the carbon-dioxide pollution that is the main source of global wanning. These citizen organizations were persuaded to take a stand by Bonner &amp; Associates, which informed them, consistent with the auto industry's political propaganda, that tougher fuel standards would make it impossible to manufacture any vehicles larger than a Ford Escort or a Honda Civic.<br><br>Vans and station wagons, small trucks and high-speed police cruisers, they were told, would cease to exist. The National Sheriffs Association was aroused by the thought of chasing criminals in a Honda Civic. The Nebraska Farm Bureau said rural America would be "devastated" if farmers tried to pull a trailer loaded with livestock or hay with a Ford Escort.<br><br>For twenty years, whenever the government has attempted to improve auto safety or environmental protection through new regulation, the auto industry has always made similar groans -- satisfying tougher standards would be impossible without dire social and economic consequences. The industry warnings have always proved to be false, but the innocent citizens recruited to speak for Detroit probably didn't know this history.<br><br>Jack Bonner was thrilled by their expressions of alarm and so was the auto industry that paid him for them. Bonner's fee, which he coyly described as somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million, was for scouring six states for potential grassroots voices, coaching them on the "facts" of the issue, paying for the phone calls and plane fares to Washington and hiring the hall for a joint press conference.<br><br>"On the clean-air bill, we bring to the table a third party -- 'white hat' groups who have no financial interest," Bonner explained. "It's not the auto industry trying to protect its financial stake. Now it's senior citizens worried about getting out of small cars with walkers. Easter Seal, Multiple Sclerosis -- a lot of these people have braces, wheelchairs, walkers. It's farm groups worrying about small trucks. It's people who need station wagons to drive kids to Little League games. These are groups with political juice and they're white hot."<br><br>In the textbook version of democracy, this activity is indistinguishable from any other form of democratic expression. In actuality, earnest citizens are being skillfully manipulated by powerful interests -- using "facts" that are debatable at best -- in a context designed to serve narrow corporate lobbying strategies, not free debate. Bonner &amp; Associates does not start by looking for citizens whose self-interest might put them on the auto industry's side. It starts with a list of the senators whose votes the auto industry needs. Then the firm forages among those senators' constituents for willing bodies.<br><br>"We sit down with the lobbyists and ask: How much heat do you want on these guys?" Bonner explained. "Do you want ten local groups or two hundred groups? Do you want one hundred phone calls from constituents or a thousand phone calls?"<br><br>Bonner's K Street office has a "boiler room" with three hundred phone lines and a sophisticated computer system, resembling the phone banks employed in election campaigns. Articulate young people sit in little booths every day, dialing around America on a variety of public issues, searching for "white hat" citizens who can be persuaded to endorse the political objectives of Mobil Oil, Dow Chemical, Citicorp, Ohio Bell, Miller Brewing, U.S. Tobacco, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and dozens of other clients.<br><br>This kind of political recruiting is expensive but not difficult. Many of the citizens are no doubt flattered to be asked, since ordinary Americans are seldom invited to participate in a personal way in the larger debates, even by the national civic organizations that presumably represent them. In a twisted sense, Jack Bonner does what political parties used to do for citizens -- he educates and agitates and mobilizes.<br><br>Since members of Congress are not naive, they understand the artificiality well enough. They know that many of the 400 million pieces of mail they receive each year are contrived by interested parties of one kind or another. Heating authentic voices from the grassroots, however, provides them with a valuable defense on controversial votes, especially when a senator intends to vote with the auto-industry lobbyists and against cleaner air. Public opinion, as every senator knows, is with the air.<br><br>"Obviously," Bonner said, "you target senators inclined to go your way but who need some additional cover. They need to be able to say they've heard from people back home on this issue. Or we target people who are genuinely undecided. It's not a good use of money to target senators who are flat opposed or who are already for you."<br><br>Corporate grassroots politics, as Bonner likes to emphasize, is really borrowed from the opposition -- the citizen "public interest" organizations, especially in the environmental movement, who first perfected the technique of generating emotional public responses with factual accusations. "Politics turns on emotion," Bonner said. "That's why industry has lost in the past and that's why we win. We bring emotion to the table."<br><br>The democratic discourse is now dominated by such transactions -- information and opinion and scholarly expertise produced by and for the self-interested sponsors. Imagine Bonner's technique multiplied and elaborated in different ways across hundreds of public issues and you may begin to envision the girth of this industry. Some firms produce artfully designed opinion polls, more or less guaranteed to yield results that suggest public support for the industry's position. Some firms specialize in coalition building -- assembling dozens or hundreds of civic organizations and interest groups in behalf of lobbying goals.<br><br>This is democracy and it costs a fortune. Democracy-for-hire smothers the contemporary political debates and, while it does not always prevail, relatively few Americans have the resources to hire a voice for themselves. David Cohen of the Advocacy Institute, which trains citizens in how to lobby for their causes, recognizes a kind of class system emerging in the political process itself. "We are moving to a system," he said, "where there are two different realms of citizens -- a society in which those with the resources are going to have the ability to dominate the debate and outcomes while others are not going to be able to draw on the tools of persuasion." If democratic expression is reduced to a question of money, then those with money will always have more.<br><br>In previous times, reformers wrote devastating critiques about the "capture" of government regulatory agencies by the industries they were supposed to regulate. The Civil Aeronautics Board became the puppet of the airlines. The Bureau of Mines was owned by the coal industry. The Federal Communications Commission belonged to the broadcasters. The occasional expos�s sometimes produced reforms though the basic problem endured.<br><br>Now, however, it is not an exaggeration to say that democracy itself has been "captured." The forms of expression, the premises and very language of debate, not to mention the rotating cadres of experts and managers, are now owned in large measure by relatively few interests, much the way that powerful industries came to own regulatory agencies. Democracy is held captive, not just by money, but by ideas -- the ideas that money buys.<br><br>Some citizens have discovered that the best way to avoid being overwhelmed by the "shadow government" of K Street is to proceed stealthfully in the legislative arena -- to launch sneak attacks before the information industry notices.<br><br>Year after year through the 1980s, Representative Byron Dorgan of North Dakota pursued this lonely strategy, as he tried to get Congress to curb the profligate buildup of junk bonds and corporate debt. As a former state tax commissioner, Dorgan understood that the Wall Street takeover deals were cannibalizing productive companies and leaving U.S. corporations dangerously overleveraged. Junk bonds didn't become a visible political issue until they started collapsing in the late 1980s, threatening the solvency of S&amp;Ls, banks and insurance companies. But Dorgan could have explained it to people years before.<br><br>"I've been giving Wall Street fits," he said, "and they're furious with me and my constituents don't quite understand why I care because we're not exposed to hostile takeovers and stuff like that in North Dakota. But, starting in 1982 when I saw what was happening on Wall Street, I just got much more interested in junk bonds and mergers."<br><br>Dorgan set out to eliminate the federal tax deductions for the interest paid on junk bonds -- the implicit federal subsidy for the deals that made the explosive buildup of corporate debt possible. If these tax breaks could be removed or scaled back, Wall Street would find fewer opportunities for raiding companies and breaking them up or leaving them mired in debt.<br><br>But the congressman did not launch a noisy campaign to alert the public to the threat posed by junk bonds. Nor did he push the Ways and Means Committee on which he serves to take up the matter directly. He did not make speeches or call press conferences. Dorgan knew all those would be futile -- and would simply alert the opposition to his intentions.<br><br>Instead, Representative Dorgan practiced the kind of guerrilla politics that is sometimes possible in the parliamentary confusions of Congress. He literally tried to sneak his amendments into tax measures before the other side found out about them. These were like midnight forays against the opposing army of lobbyists and financial experts (and sometimes even occurred late at night when legislators were weary and the army was asleep). Sometimes, he even succeeded.<br><br>Byron Dorgan's personal campaign against junk bonds illustrates how much the legislative process has been distort...</p><h2>Against the Night: Living in the New Dark Ages</h2><p>Argues that the U.S. is on the eve of a new dark age and explains how the Christian community can turn the situation around</p><p>Charles Colson, former aide to President Nixon, founded Prison Fellowship Ministries in 1976, after doing a prison term himself. It has since become the world&#39;s largest outreach to prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families. Colson is also a popular speaker and author, having written 23 books, which collectively have sold more than five million copies. His radio feature &#34;BreakPoint&#34; is aired daily on some 1,000 outlets nationwide."A crisis of immense proportion is upon us": the erosion of traditional values in the institutions of family, state, and church. This is Colson's premise in this spiritual call-to-arms, whose ideas were first presented as lectures at Wheaton College. He starts with a critique of Enlightenment assumptions, exposes the relativism and decadence he finds to be rampant today, and closes with a challenge to Christians to stem the tide. This resembles Dee Jepsen's What's Happening to My World ?

Now in paperback, <i>The Toltec Way</i> is a book created specifically to bring this ancient wisdom to readers in a way that is easily understood and that makes it applicable to modern life.</p><p>The gift of the Toltec is in being able to transcend ordinary human awareness and achieve personal freedom. Simply put, personal freedom is the ability to choose how to act rather than react to the events in your life. The three Toltec Masteries of Awareness, Transformation, and Intent are the key to transcending your limitations and experiencing yourself as the creator of your life.</p><p>This book is about change and changing yourself. It emphasizes the need to take personal responsibility for the choices in your life. Included in each chapter are exercises and guided visualizations. And, because the wisdom to be learned is often best encountered indirectly, you will find that some of the most important knowledge is hidden in the parablelike stories that are scattered throughout the book.</p></p><p>Like Don Miquel Ruiz, author of the bestselling book <i>The Four Agreements</i>, author Susan Gregg teaches readers how the ancient Toltec tradition can apply to life in the 21st century. For those who haven't watched <i>Oprah</i> lately, the Toltecs were an ancient race of people who flourished in Southern Mexico around 800 AD. "They were also a secret society dedicated to preserving the knowledge of the 'ancient ones,' who were great spiritual masters," according to Gregg. Gregg explains that the Toltec tradition is a way of seeing beyond our perceived sense of reality and into an unlimited world of possibility.<p> Since Gregg is a dedicated teacher of this exciting (and yes, even faddish) Toltec tradition, she emphasizes basic tools and specific examples rather than obscure parables and philosophies. Chapter titles such as "Letting Go of the Past," "Finding a Happiness That Lasts," and "Where to Go for Support" sound more like self-help chapters than enticing discussions of mystical beliefs. But that's Gregg's point--why make this reality-blowing tradition obscure and inaccessible when its whole purpose is that of spiritual empowerment? As a push-up-your-sleeves-and-get-started primer, it can't be beat. But if you're looking for more lyrical or pensive prose, turn to Don Miquel or Don Juan. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p><b>Dr. Susan Gregg </b>has studied the Toltec oral traditions under Sister Sarita and don Miguel Ruiz, and is now a Toltec Master and Nagual.

Hardy has to be one of the most remarkable. A PoW for three-and-a-half years, Hardy made no less than twelve escape attempts while imprisoned by the Germans in the First World War, five of which being successful.<br><br>In early 1915 he attempted to escape from Halle Camp, near Leipzig, by breaking through a brick wall into an adjacent ammunition factory. After five-months work the project proved impracticable. In the summer of 1915 he was transferred to Augustabad Camp, near Neu Brandenburg, and after being there 10 days he managed to slip away from a bathing party outside the camp, together with a Russian officer. After a difficult journey they covered the 50 miles to the Baltic coast. They swam a river, were nearly recaptured once, but eventually reached Stralsund. They nearly managed to get the crew of a Swedish schooner there to give them passage, but were arrested at the last moment.<br><br>Hardy was returned to Halle and joined an unsuccessful attempt with a group of Russian officers to break down a wall. He then made a solo escape attempt by picking locks and breaking through a skylight before sliding down a rope onto the street. From here he slipped into the rain and darkness. He spoke enough German to make his way by train to Bremen. Here, broken down by cold and hunger, the Germans recaptured him.<br><br>He was then transferred to Magdeburg, where he escaped with a Belgian officer using "subterfuge, audacity and good fortune". They reached Berlin by train, and went on to Stralsund. From there they crossed to the island of Rugen, but were arrested before they could find a fishing boat to take them to Sweden. His next prisoner of war camp was Fort Zorndorf, from where escape was virtually impossible. Nevertheless he made several attempts, and one nearly succeeded when, with two others, he almost got out disguised as a German soldier.<br><br>Hardy was transferred around further and made subsequent escape attempts until he finally managed to escape for good in March 1918, after being a PoW for over three-and-a-half years.<br><br>Written in Hardy&#x2019;s own words, this book reads like a wartime thriller or Hollywood screenplay and his Great War story makes for fascinating reading.</p><p>Captain Jocelyn Lee Hardy DSO MC was a British Army officer famed for his courage on the battlefield and repeated escapes from German prisoner of war camps during the First World War, the details of which are found in this book. Born in 1894 and seeing action in the war as earlier as 24 August 1914, Hardy&#39;s unit acted as a rearguard to cover the retreat of 5th Infantry Brigade at Le Grand Fayt. On 26 August Hardy was reported as missing in action and spent the best part of the next three and a half years as a prisoner of war. Hardy continued to serve in the Army until 1925 when he retired on account of ill-health. He was the author of seven books, I Escape! being his first. He died in 1958, aged sixty-three.</p><h2>Under Heaven</h2><p>NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br>A <i>Globe and Mail</i> Top 100 Book<br>A <i>Washington</i> <i> Post</i> Best Fiction Book <p>Each night for two years Shen Tai has listened to the ghosts of dead soldiers in the darkness outside his isolated cabin.

One of the things that Kay&#x2019;s books have in common is their way to leave the reader breathless. There is so much emotion in some parts of Under Heaven that it&#x2019;s almost like his signature for me to read it with my heart at my throat....

Although he uses the same repertoire as other authors&#x2014;characterization, plot, atmosphere, etc.&#x2014;somehow they are employed in such a manner that we&#x2019;re not aware of them as individual components. Like dancers and music they move together in such harmony we can enjoy the image they create without noticing the steps taken to bring it about.

This is a magnificent creation that you will want to read over and over again for the joy of reading it brings you.&#x201d; - Blog Critics<br><br>&#x201c;Guy Gavriel Kay, hunting in the twilight zone between fact and dream, has written a shimmering novel, a fantasia on Tang China, the epitome of Chinese civilization, as beautiful and as alien as the rings of Saturn ... a beautiful, compulsive read...&#x201d; - Locus<br><br>&#x201c;What a lush and expansive world Kay has created here.

Indeed, Under Heaven showcases a Guy Gavriel Kay at the top of his game.... I feel that Kay captured the moods and nuances of his chosen setting to perfection. And this richness of details makes for an even more impressive reading experience. Still, beyond the vividly depicted environment, it&#x2019;s the superb characterization that makes Under Heaven impossible to put down.... Award-winning author Guy Gavriel Kay has been one of my favorite writers for years. Hence, it came as no surprise that Under Heaven turned out to be a gorgeous and unforgettable work. I expected no less from Kay. What I didn&#x2019;t expect was the feeling of awe that left me speechless when I reached the end.&#x201d; - Fantasy Hotlist</p><h2>Building a Low Impact Roundhouse, 4th Edition</h2><p><p>In <em>Building a Low Impact Roundhouse</em>, Tony shares his many years of experience, skills, and techniques used to build this unique and affordable low-impact home. Always witty and inspiring, the author explains the process of visualizing and designing a house through to the practical side of lifting the living roof, infilling the walls, laying out rooms, and adding renewable, autonomous technology.</p> <p><em>Building a Low Impact Roundhouse</em> has become a classic text sold all over the world. Tony&#x2019;s home and lifestyle have attracted much media interest, and he and his partner continue to inspire many individuals and communities to seek out ways of living more sustainably.</p> <p>Now in its third edition, with a fascinating ten-year update including a major new section on the couple&#x2019;s marvelous straw bale den, Tony also includes sections on the physical design, and he writes about the lifestyle required for living in a roundhouse. He offers advice on roofs, floors, walls, compost toilets, wood stoves, kitchens, windows, and planning permission. There are additional photographs of life in and around the dwelling and illustrations from the construction plans for one of the UK&#x2019;s most unique homes.</p> <p>This true and captivating story covers the realizing of a lifetime&#x2019;s dream as well as being a practical &#x201c;how to&#x201d; manual for anyone who loves the idea of low-impact living and wants to self-build an affordable, organic home.</p></p><p><p>In 1993, Tony Wrench developed the concept of &#x201c;permaculture land&#x201d;, a low-impact sustainable way of life that included self-building with local materials, appropriate technology, and food growing. In 1997, he and his partner built and moved into a low-impact roundhouse.</p>This book is a description of the fascinating process that would lead through the design of the structure, the detailing, the construction and the fitting out. It is not a technical treatise in any sense, though the basic sketches could be used to build a similar structure. There are many good photos to back up the text, and they give a better sense of scale than the line illustrations. The book is well written with a good deal of wit and logical explanation, by a permie who is obviously in tune with living sustainably and willing to eschew much of the baggage we take for granted, but is still able to live simply and luxuriously.

Her poems have appeared in <b>The New Yorker</b>, in various anthologies, and in her own three volumes of poetry. She divides her time between South Dakota and Hawaii.</p>It's a great title and, yes, Norris recreates college life in the '60s, but the bulk of this story takes place in New York, where the aspiring poet worked for Betty Kray at the Academy of American Poets. Part coming-of-age revelation and part tribute to Kray, this literate memoir is broken into non-chronological segments sometimes not well defined by Sandra Burr. The text provides few dynamics, so one can't expect fireworks in the reading, but Burr's voice is clear, and her tone earnest. It's almost as if Norris, who later wrote of monastic life, is getting this all off her chest. Burr brings out the author's spiritual side, as well as her near-veneration of Kray. This is a good look (or listen) at the poetry scene of the '70s.

Nine o'clock Saturday morning. Early for the telephone. Woodward fumbled for the receiver and snapped awake. The city editor of the <i>Washington Post</i> was on the line. Five men had been arrested earlier that morning in a burglary at Democratic headquarters, carrying photographic equipment and electronic gear. Could he come in?<br><br>Woodward had worked for the Post for only nine months and was always looking for a good Saturday assignment, but this didn't sound like one. A burglary at the local Democratic headquarters was too much like most of what he had been doing -- investigative pieces on unsanitary restaurants and small-time police corruption. Woodward had hoped he had broken out of that; he had just finished a series of stories on the attempted assassination of Alabama Governor George Wallace. Now, it seemed, he was back in the same old slot.<br><br>Woodward left his one-room apartment in downtown Washington and walked the six blocks to the <i>Post.</i> The newspaper's mammoth newsroom -- over 150 feet square with rows of brightly colored desks set on an acre of sound-absorbing carpet -- is usually quiet on Saturday morning. Saturday is a day for long lunches, catching up on work, reading the Sunday supplements. As Woodward stopped to pick up his mail and telephone messages at the front of the newsroom, he noticed unusual activity around the city desk. He checked in with the city editor and learned with surprise that the burglars had not broken into the small local Democratic Party office but the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office-apartment-hotel complex.<br><br>It was an odd place to find the Democrats. The opulent Watergate, on the banks of the Potomac in downtown Washington, was as Republican as the Union League Club. Its tenants included the former Attorney General of the United States John N. Mitchell, now director of the Committee for the Re-election of the President; the former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans, finance chairman of the President's campaign; the Republican national chairman, Senator Robert Dole of Kansas; President Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary Woods; and Anna Chennault, who was the widow of Flying Tiger ace Claire Chennault and a celebrated Republican hostess; plus many other prominent figures of the Nixon administration.<br><br>The futuristic complex, with its serpent's-teeth concrete balustrades and equally menacing prices ($100,000 for many of its two-bedroom cooperative apartments), had become the symbol of the ruling class in Richard Nixon's Washington. Two years earlier, it had been the target of 1000 anti-Nixon demonstrators who had shouted "Pigs," "Fascists" and <i>"Sieg Heil"</i> as they tried to storm the citadel of Republican power. They had run into a solid wall of riot-equipped Washington policemen who had pushed them back onto the campus of George Washington University with tear gas and billy clubs. From their balconies, anxious tenants of the Watergate had watched the confrontation, and some had cheered and toasted when the protesters were driven back and the westerly winds off the Potomac chased the tear gas away from the fortress. Among those who had been knocked to the ground was <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Carl Bernstein. The policeman who had sent him sprawling had probably not seen the press cards hanging from his neck, and had perhaps focused on his longish hair.<br><br>As Woodward began making phone calls, he noticed that Bernstein, one of the paper's two Virginia political reporters, was working on the burglary story, too.<br><br>Oh God, not Bernstein, Woodward thought, recalling several office tales about Bernstein's ability to push his way into a good story and get his byline on it.<br><br>That morning, Bernstein had Xeroxed copies of notes from reporters at the scene and informed the city editor that he would make some more checks. The city editor had shrugged his acceptance, and Bernstein had begun a series of phone calls to everybody at the Watergate he could reach -- desk clerks, bellmen, maids in the housekeeping department, waiters in the restaurant.<br><br>Bernstein looked across the newsroom. There was a pillar between his desk and Woodward's, about 25 feet away. He stepped back several paces. It appeared that Woodward was also working on the story. That figured, Bernstein thought. Bob Woodward was a prima donna who played heavily at office politics. Yale. A veteran of the Navy officer corps. Lawns, greensward, staterooms and grass tennis courts, Bernstein guessed, but probably not enough pavement for him to be good at investigative reporting. Bernstein knew that Woodward couldn't write very well. One office rumor had it that English was not Woodward's native language.<br><br>Bernstein was a college dropout. He had started as a copy boy at the <i>Washington Star</i> when he was 16, become a full-time reporter at 19, and had worked at the Post since 1966. He occasionally did investigative series, had covered the courts and city hall, and liked to do long, discursive pieces about the capital's people and neighborhoods.<br><br>Woodward knew that Bernstein occasionally wrote about rock music for the <i>Post.</i> That figured. When he learned that Bernstein sometimes reviewed classical music, he choked that down with difficulty. Bernstein looked like one of those counterculture journalists that Woodward despised. Bernstein thought that Woodward's rapid rise at the <i>Post</i> had less to do with his ability than his Establishment credentials.<br><br>They had never worked on a story together. Woodward was 29, Bernstein 28.<br><br>The first details of the story had been phoned from inside the Watergate by Alfred E. Lewis, a veteran of 35 years of police reporting for the <i>Post.</i> Lewis was something of a legend in Washington journalism -- half cop, half reporter, a man who often dressed in a blue regulation Metropolitan Police sweater buttoned at the bottom over a brass Star-of-David buckle. In 35 years, Lewis had never really "written" a story; he phoned the details in to a rewrite man, and for years the <i>Washington Post</i> did not even have a typewriter at police headquarters.<br><br>The five men arrested at 2:30 A.M. had been dressed in business suits and all had worn Playtex rubber surgical gloves. Police had seized a walkie-talkie, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35-millimeter cameras, lock picks, pen-size tear-gas guns, and bugging devices that apparently were capable of picking up both telephone and room conversations.<br><br>"One of the men had $814, one $800, one $215, one $234, one $230," Lewis had dictated. "Most of it was in $100 bills, in sequence....They seemed to know their way around; at least one of them must have been familiar with the layout. They had rooms on the second and third floors of the hotel? The men ate lobster in the restaurant there, all at the same table that night. One wore a suit bought in Raleigh's. Somebody got a look at the breast pocket."<br><br>Woodward learned from Lewis that the suspects were going to appear in court that afternoon for a preliminary hearing? He decided to go.<br><br>Woodward had been to the courthouse before. The heating procedure was an institutionalized fixture of the local court's turnstile system of justice: A quick appearance before a judge who set bond for accused pimps, prostitutes, muggers -- and, on this day, the five men who had been arrested at the Watergate.<br><br>A group of attorneys -- known as the "Fifth Street Lawyers" because of the location of the courthouse and their storefront offices -- were hanging around the corridors as usual, waiting for appointments as government-paid counsel to indigent defendants. Two of the regulars -- a tall, thin attorney in a frayed sharkskin suit and an obese, middle-aged lawyer who had once been disciplined for soliciting cases in the basement cellblock -- were muttering their distress. They had been tentatively appointed to represent the five accused Watergate burglars and had then been informed that the men had retained their own counsel, which is unusual.<br><br>Woodward went inside the courtroom. One person stood out. In a middle row sat a young man with fashionably long hair and an expensive suit with slightly flared lapels, his chin high, his eyes searching the room as if he were in unfamiliar surroundings.<br><br>Woodward sat down next to him and asked if he was in court because of the Watergate arrests.<br><br>"Perhaps," the man said. "I'm not the attorney of record. I'm acting as an individual."<br><br>He said his name was Douglas Caddy and he introduced a small, anemic-looking man next to him as the attorney of record, Joseph Rafferty, Jr. Rafferty appeared to have been routed out of bed; he was unshaven and squinted as if the light hurt his eyes. The two lawyers wandered in and out of the courtroom. Woodward finally cornered Rafferty in a hallway and got the names and addresses of the five suspects. Four of them were from Miami, three of them Cuban-Americans.<br><br>Caddy didn't want to talk. "Please don't take it personally," he told Woodward. "It would be a mistake to do that. I just don't have anything to say."<br><br>Woodward asked Caddy about his clients.<br><br>"They are not my clients," he said.<br><br>But you are a lawyer? Woodward asked.<br><br>"I'm not going to talk to you."<br><br>Caddy walked back into the courtroom. Woodward followed.<br><br>"Please, I have nothing to say."<br><br>Would the five men be able to post bond? Woodward asked.<br><br>After politely refusing to answer several more times, Caddy replied quickly that the men were all employed and had families -- factors that would be taken into consideration by the judge in setting bond. He walked back into the corridor.<br><br>Woodward followed: Just tell me about yourself, how you got into the case.<br><br>"I'm not in the case."<br><br>Why are you here?<br><br>"Look," Caddy said, "I met one of the defendants, Bernard Barker, at a social occasion.<br><br>"Where?<br><br>"In D.C. It was cocktails at the Army-Navy Club. We had a sympathetic conversation...that's all I'm going to say.<br><br>"How did you get into the case?<br><br>Caddy pivoted and walked back in. After half an hour, he went out again.<br><br>Woodward asked how he got into the case.<br><br>This time Caddy said he'd gotten a call shortly after 3:00 A.M. from Barker's wife. "She said her husband had told her to call me if he hadn't called her by three, that it might mean he was in trouble."<br><br>Caddy said he was probably the only attorney Barker knew in Washington, and brushed off more questions, adding that he had probably said too much.<br><br>At 3:30 P.M., the five suspects, still dressed in dark business suits but stripped of their belts and ties, were led into the courtroom by a marshal. They seated themselves silently in a row and stared blankly toward the bench, kneading their hands. They looked nervous, respectful and tough.<br><br>Earl Silbert, the government prosecutor, rose as their case was called by the clerk. Slight, intent and owlish with his horn-rimmed glasses, he was known as "Earl the Pearl" to Fifth Streeters familiar with his fondness for dramatic courtroom gestures and flowery speech. He argued that the five men should not be released on bond. They had given false names, had not cooperated with the police, possessed "$2300 in cold cash, and had a tendency to travel abroad." They had been arrested in a "professional burglary" with a "clandestine" purpose. Silbert drew out the word "clandestine."<br><br>Judge James A. Belsen asked the men their professions. One spoke up, answering that they were "anti-communists," and the others nodded their agreement. The Judge, accustomed to hearing unconventional job descriptions, nonetheless appeared perplexed. The tallest of the suspects, who had given his name as James W. McCord, Jr., was asked to step forward. He was balding, with a large, flat nose, a square jaw, perfect teeth and a benign expression that seemed incongruous with his hard-edged features.<br><br>The Judge asked his occupation.<br><br>"Security consultant," he replied.<br><br>The Judge asked where.<br><br>McCord, in a soft drawl, said that he had recently retired from government service. Woodward moved to the front row and leaned forward.<br><br>"Where in government?" asked the Judge.<br><br>"CIA," McCord whispered.<br><br>The Judge flinched slightly.<br><br>Holy shit, Woodward said half aloud, the CIA.<br><br>He got a cab back to the office and reported McCord's statement. Eight reporters were involved in putting together the story under the byline of Alfred E. Lewis. As the 6:30 P.M. deadline approached, Howard Simons, the <i>Post's</i> managing editor, came into the city editor's office at the south side of the newsroom. "That's a hell of a story," he told the city editor, Barry Sussman, and ordered it onto Sunday's front page.<br><br>The first paragraph of the story read: "Five men, one of whom said he is a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, were arrested at 2:30 A.M. yesterday in what authorities described as an elaborate plot to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee here."<br><br>A federal grand jury investigation had already been announced, but even so it was Simons' opinion that there still were too many unknown factors about the break-in to make it the lead story. "It could be crazy Cubans," he said.<br><br>Indeed, the thought that the break-in might somehow be the work of the Republicans seemed implausible. On June 17, 1972, less than a month before the Democratic convention, the President stood ahead of all announced Democratic candidates in the polls by no less than 19 points. Richard Nixon's vision of an emerging Republican majority that would dominate the last quarter of the century, much as the Democrats had dominated two previous generations, appeared possible. The Democratic Party was in disarray as a brutal primary season approached its end. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, considered by the White House and Democratic Party professionals alike to be Nixon's weakest opponent, was emerging as the clear favorite to win the Democrats' nomination for President.<br><br>The story noted: "There was no immediate explanation as to why the five suspects would want to bug the Democratic National Committee offices, or whether or not they were working for any other individuals or organizations."<br><br>Bernstein had written another story for the Sunday paper on the suspects. Four were from Miami: Bernard L. Barker, Frank A. Sturgis, Virgilio R. Gonzalez and Eugenio R. Martinez. He had called a <i>Miami Herald</i> reporter and obtained a long list of Cuban exile leaders. A Post reporter had been sent from the President's press party in Key Biscayne to make checks in Miami's Cuban community. All four of the Miami suspects had been involved in anti-Castro activities and were also said to have CIA connections. ("I've never known if he works for the CIA or not," Mrs. Barker told Bernstein. "The men never tell the women anything about that.") Sturgis, an American soldier-of-fortune and the only non-Cuban among them, had been recruiting militant Cubans to demonstrate at the Democratic national convention, according to several persons. One Cuban leader told Bernstein that Sturgis and others whom he described as "former CIA types" intended to use paid provocateurs to fight anti-war demonstrators in the streets during the national political conventions.<br><br>Woodward left the office about eight o'clock that Saturday night. He knew he should have stayed later to track down James McCord. He had not even checked the local telephone directory to see if there was a James McCord listed in Washington or its suburbs.<br><br>The national staff of the <i>Washington Post</i> rarely covers police stories. So, at Sussman's request, both B...</p><h2>New Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 2: Baa-Cam</h2><p><p>Volume 2 of the 15-volume series. </p><p>Since 1967, the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia</em>, cited by Library Journal as one of the top 50 reference sources of the millennium, has been a standard in public, academic, and high school libraries worldwide.

Chaon imagines today's family instinctively trying to stay together, only to find itself lost in the throes of a chaotic, modern world.<br><br>In "Safety Man," a young widow and her children become increasingly attached to an inflatable protector-doll, as the world outside seems to grow ever more threatening; "Big Me" follows a lonely, imaginative twelve-year-old boy who believes an older (slightly creepier) version of himself has moved in next door; In "I Demand to Know Where You're Taking Me," a man blinded by love for his imprisoned brother ignores the warnings of his distant wife and a talking parrot who both witness things he's never seen; and "Among the Missing" explores how the death of a family, found buckled in their car at the bottom of a lake, casts a shadow on a small town and intrudes upon the narrator's relationship with his aging mother.<br><br>A writer of enormous talent and emotional depth, Dan Chaon mines the psychological landscape of his characters to dazzling effect. Each story radiates with sharp humor, mystery, wonder, and startling compassion. Among the Missing lingers in the mind through its subtle grace and power of language.</p><p>Dan Chaon opens his new collection of stories with an epigraph from Raymond Carver: "Whatever this was all about, it was not a vain attempt--journey." This is pretty opaque stuff from Carver, a writer not much given to mystification. But it strikes just the right note for Chaon's assembly of characters, a group vaguely unsettled by life, trying to make the best of it. First and foremost, this is a book beset by moms. You get the feeling that the characters in <i>Among the Missing</i> never really had a chance to figure out the world, with these cryptic, uncommunicative women to care for them. In the title story, for example, a car is discovered at the bottom of a local lake, with an entire family drowned inside. The college-age narrator, however, is preoccupied by the more mundane puzzle of his parents' relationship. "Somehow," he recounts, "they'd stayed married for twenty years, and then, abruptly, somehow they'd decided to give up. It didn't quite make sense, and I looked at them, for a minute aware of the other mystery in my life. 'Do you want some soup?' my mother asked, as if I were a customer."<p> That's about as much as you'll ever get out of one of Chaon's mothers: soup. When not fielding their aging parents' passivity, these characters seem to spend a lot of time grappling with ghosts. The "missing" of the title story are, literally, gone. In "Safety Man," a widow comes to rely on one of those inflatable dolls meant to intimidate intruders. In "Prosthesis," a young wife and mother falls for a stranger with a missing arm; meanwhile, she watches her son grow up and away from her, "disappearing into his own thoughts and feelings." In the end, Chaon is the rare writer who deserves comparison to Carver: both write an affectless prose that takes on a surprisingly emotional life of its own. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>&#x201c;Dan Chaon knows things.

An imaginary figure in many respects, the invention of both the media and the people who played the beatnik role and the character quickly assumed nearly mythic proportions for the American public. Coffeehouses, beards, poetry, drugs, and free-wheeling sexuality were all associated with the beatnik, the quintessential&nbsp;rebel who, by rejecting material values, represented both a threat and an alluring alternative to the dominant middle-class culture.</p><p>In this fascinating book, John Arthur Maynard tells the story of the poets and promoters who invented the Beat Generation and who, in many cases, destroyed themselves in the process. In this look at the least remembered (but in its time, most publicized) beat enclave, Maynard focuses on two of Venice's most newsworthy residents: Lawrence Lipton and Stuart Z. Perkoff. Lipton began as a writer of popular detective stories and screenplays, but was determined to be recognized as a poet and social critic. He eventually published The Holy Barbarians, which helped to create the enduring public image of the beatnik. Stuart Perkoff was a more gifted poet; with fascination and horror, we follow his failed attempts to support his family, his heroin addiction, his first wive's courage and mental fragility, his sexual entanglements, his imprisonment, and the development of his own writing. Other characters who move in and out of the story are Kenneth Rexroth, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, as well as lesser-known poets, artists, hangers-on, and the many women who were rarely treated as full members of the community.</p><p>For most of the 1950s, the Venice beatniks were able to live and work in isolation. Once the media decided that beats made good copy, however, their peace was shattered. Reporters, drug dealers, violent criminals, and would-be beatniks invaded Venice in such force that many "square" residents began an unrelenting campaign to purge their community of bohemianism. This campaign persisted long after the beats, who tended to ignore politics, had yielded the stage to a new generation of political activists.&nbsp; In this collective biography, based largely on unpublished sources, Maynard tells us how these events affected public perceptions and the beats' own perceptions of themselves.</p></p><p>John Arthur Maynard is a historian who lives in Simi Valley in southern California.Ponderously serious book about a California cult upheaval that prefigured the better-known rage of hippie bohemianism. Applying the full academic treatment, self-described historian Maynard, a Californian, delivers a defeating book that seems always to be promising a breakthrough for its beatnik subjects--and yet releases them only in death. There are some fast pages midway where the beatniks of Venice West attain a single season in the sun, but the public appetite for fads moves on, and the town goes into a long, lingering death rattle that cannot lift Maynard's literary sociology into brilliance and great humor. Venice was founded in 1905 ``as a genteel retreat for esthetically-minded Los Angeles businessmen'' and quickly became ``the Coney Island of the West.'' The ocean-front town was built in imitation of Venice, Italy, with a Grand Canal, Bridge of Sighs, miles of canals, and imported Venetian gondolas. It was much in decay by the late 1950's (Orson Welles used it as the vile bordertown in 1958's Touch of Evil), when Lawrence Lipton was readying his research on his fellow Venice bohemians, to be called The Holy Barbarians. Lipton--who seems to have been an oddly repulsive fellow--surrounded himself with callow, unformed poets, wanted to make a big statement of his opinions, and chose to ride his friends as a hobbyhorse for his breast-beating and tub-thumping. Alas for Lipton, the Kerouac/Ginsberg axis stole much of his thunder, and Venice West never achieved quite the recognition of Haight Ashbury. Despite some early ink in Life magazine and time on TV, which suddenly threw a hot spotlight on Venice, the town soon closed up as a beat enclave and its greatest literary lights (dim bulbs all) could not survive drugs, cancer, madness, or old age. What should have been a lively, eccentric book wilts under a pall of dreary sociology. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Did you know that:</p><ul><li>You'll heal faster after surgery if you see trees and grass outside your window than if you're looking at a brick wall.</li><li>After asthmatic children were given vanilla aroma to use with their inhalers, their asthma eventually improved in response to the vanilla alone, even when the inhalers contained no active drug.</li><li>Some patients who had sham angina surgery performed in a double-blind experiment showed improvements lasting six months or more, which their physicians could not distinguish from the results in patients who had had the real surgery.</li><li>When people watched a movie showing Mother Teresa taking care of the poor in Calcutta, their bodies secreted extra amounts of salivary immunoglobulin A, a major germ-fighting chemical.</li><li>When Japanese teenagers, who were allergic to a tree similar to poison ivy, were touched with leaves from a harmless chestnut tree, they developed severe rashes. When touched with the poisonous leaves but told they were chestnut, they had no reaction whatsoever.</li><li>When a new medical treatment is introduced with much excitement and hope, the first patients to receive it typically show a seventy percent positive response rate, even in cases where the treatment--on more careful study-is shown to be medically worthless.</li></ul><p><em>The Placebo Response,</em> grounded in comprehensive research, presents a convincing case that we can harness our inner pharmacy for better health and healing.</p></p><p>Could a tiny sugar pill actually hold the secret to a miracle cure? In his well-researched new book, Dr. Howard Brody, a family practice physician and university professor, brings forward an intriguing, and provocative, premise about the healing effect of placebos, the much-maligned fake cure of popular lore. Brody asserts that while placebos themselves have no medical value, time and again real illnesses and pain have been diminished by their use.<p> According to Brody, the placebo phenomenon--which he pronounces mysterious and unknowable at its very heart--is when the convergence of healing signals, assigned meaning, and human expectations stimulates the body's inner healing power. The patient's positive mental and emotional reaction to a medical intervention releases what Brody terms the "inner pharmacy." In other words, even though the treatment is benign, the body's biochemical pathways are stimulated to induce healing in the same manner actual medicines do. "Could harboring hope, faith, or expectation be genuinely potent factors in the healing process?" Brody asks, "I believe they are. In fact, I see them as the heart and soul of the placebo response."</p><p> In this lucid, easy-to-follow book, Brody lays the foundation for his argument by reviewing the history of placebo use as well as the results of several major studies. He takes ample time up front to explore a variety of theories about why placebos work, who responds to them, and the role of the medical provider in the process. The later half of the book is devoted to guiding individuals who wish to release their own internal healing power. One of Brody's primary contentions is that patients are not inert objects in this process: they must take control of their own health before the healing response can be unleashed.</p><p> Is the public's rising confidence in the effectiveness of alternative medicine partially a result of the placebo effect? According to Brody, the more personal, caring treatment offered by alternative providers could be more effective in releasing the placebo response in patients who do not respond well to conventional medical approaches. His premise: the tenor of the healing message as well as the carrier of that message are key to stimulating--or shutting down--the inner pharmacy. A provider who does not believe in the patient's ability to heal can inadvertently cause the opposite reaction--the "nocebo effect."

More than a mere argument in support of freedom and equality for women, it is a compelling depiction of the subtle burdens that had been traditionally borne by women and the awareness that perhaps there are options.</p></p><p><p><b>Kate Chopin's classic, an American <i>Anna Karenina</i></b><b><i>, </i>joins Canongate's Canons series. </b></p><p><b>With an introduction </b><b>by Barbara Kingsolver</b></p>Edna Pontellier is a young woman living comfortably in the beautiful city of New Orleans.

Now he and his wife, Dark Rain, have created a magnificent portrait of an astonishing woman&#x2013;one who led her people in war when she could not persuade them to make peace.<br><br>Her name was Nonhelema. Literate, lovely, imposing at over six feet tall, she was the Women&#x2019;s Peace Chief of the Shawnee Nation&#x2013;and already a legend when the most decisive decade of her life began in 1774. That fall, with more than three thousand Virginians poised to march into the Shawnees&#x2019; home, Nonhelema&#x2019;s plea for peace was denied.

He was influenced not only by Surrealism, but also by the Russian Symbolism, to which he added elements of Cubism.

This is the question asked of us by Napoleon Hill. Originally published in 1937, and selling more than 60 million copies worldwide, Hill&#39;s Think and Grow Rich is the classic motivational book. Inspired by Andrew Carnegie, Hill studied the work and lives of some of the most successful people of the Industrial Era including Ford, Wrigley, Eastman, Rockefeller, Edison, Woolworth, Burbank, Morgan, and Firestone as well as three United States Presidents. From his 20 plus years of research into the characteristics of what launched these individuals into greatness and wealth, Hill developed his 13 universal principles, meant to inspire any individual to a richer, fuller life. The true genius of his writing is the simple way in which he explains that wealth comes from seeing your goal in your mind and making it happen, no matter what.</p><p>In every chapter of this book, mention has been made of the money-making secret which has made fortunes for hundreds of exceedingly wealthy men whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years. <p> The secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, more than half a century ago. the canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it into my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to understand the full significance of what he had said to me. </p><p> When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to spend twenty years or more preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have kept my promise.

A range of well-known authors contribute pieces (Amy Ignatow, Libba Bray, Raina Telgemeier, Ursula Vernon, and Shannon Hale) along with lesser-known writers. The pinkish cover, depicting a girl dangling upside down and reading Funny Girl, is appealing, as are the accessible font styles and comic illustrations throughout. Many of the stories describe bodily functions (farts, poo, pee, and periods all make appearances), proving boys don't have a monopoly on toilet humor. Though the majority of the humor is lighthearted and kid-appropriate, some jokes hit a sour note. In the first story, "How To Tell a Joke" by Delaney Yeager and Mackenzie Yeager, the narrator relates the tale of watching an antidrug assembly featuring a former drug addict with a prosthetic hand. She explains how she later imitated the man by putting her own hand inside her shirt and suggests that this is a good way to get laughs from classmates&#x2014;a gag she comes back to several times in the chapter. Readers whose families have experienced addiction or who have physical disabilities are likely to find these jokes painful rather than chuckle-worthy. Authors and characters come from a range of backgrounds, including Cuban American, Native American, and Indian American. A short biography of each author can be found in the back matter. The stories work especially well when read consecutively, since several jokes recur, but most pieces stand alone. VERDICT With the exception of the first chapter's insensitivity, these stories are bound to engage most readers and tickle ribs.&#x2014;Michelle Anderson, Tauranga City Libraries, New Zealand</p><h2>The Story of India</h2><p>This sumptuously illustrated book with its magical mix of history and travelogue will provide an unforgettable portrait of India.<br><br>In this lavishly illustrated companion to his BBC TV series, Michael Wood weaves a spellbinding narrative out of the 10,000-year history of India. Home today to more than a fifth of the world&#x2019;s population, the subcontinent gave birth to the oldest and most influential civilization on Earth, to four world religions, and to the world&#x2019;s largest democracy. Now, as India bids to become a global giant, Michael sets out to trace the roots of India&#x2019;s present in the incredible riches of her past.<br><br>From the Khyber Pass and the Himalayas to the tropical jungles of India&#x2019;s Deep South, this original and striking survey of Indian history provides vivid portraits of India&#x2019;s regions and cultures, and new insights into some of history&#x2019;s greatest figures: the Buddha and Ashoka, Samudragupta and Akbar the Great, Nehru and Gandhi. It explores the ways in which Indian ideas and inventions have shaped the history of the world, and shows how some of ancient India&#x2019;s conclusions about the nature of civilization have lost none of their relevance for our own times.<br>Dazzling colour photographs capture an extraordinary spectrum of landscapes, architectural splendours, customs, rituals and festivals. This sumptuously illustrated book from one of Britain&#x2019;s best-loved historians and broadcasters is a magical mixture of history and travelogue, and an unforgettable portrait of India, past, present &#x2014; and future.</p><p>Michael Wood is a highly respected author and TV presenter with over eighty documentary films to his name, most recently the acclaimed <b>In Search of Myths and Heroes</b>.In a style that blends encyclopedic knowledge with a travel narrative, Wood (In Search of the Trojan War) presents the history of a country which, he claims, is itself "a tale of incredible drama, of great inventions and phenomenal creativity, and of the biggest ideas." Combining ancient and recent history with archaeology, anthropology, religion and linguistic studies, Wood provides a thorough view of India's journey to the present. Woods has a long personal history with the country and he uses it to great effect, combining first person accounts (such as hunting down an original manuscript of the ancient Rig-Veda text in a Calcutta library and stopping for tea at the "bazaar of storytellers") with discursive accounts of Tamil literature, the analysis of Hindu legends and subtle historical interpretation. As in the past, India's greatest strength, Wood claims, will be to "adapt and change, to use the gifts of history and to accept its wounds, but somehow, magically, to always be India." Filled with photographs and artwork, this is an excellent primer for anyone wishing to know about the evolution of this growing world power. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah Dessen comes a big-hearted, sweeping novel about a girl who reconnects with a part of her family she hasn&#39;t seen since she was a little girl--and falls in love, all over the course of a magical summer. Emma Saylor doesn&#39;t remember a lot about her mother, who died when Emma was twelve. But she does remember the stories her mom told her about the big lake that went on forever, with cold, clear water and mossy trees at the edges. Now it&#39;s just Emma and her dad, and life is good, if a little predictable...until Emma is unexpectedly sent to spend the summer with her mother&#39;s family that she hasn&#39;t seen since she was a little girl. When Emma arrives at North Lake, she realizes there are actually two very different communities there. Her mother grew up in working class North Lake, while her dad spent summers in the wealthier Lake North resort. The more time Emma spends there, the more it starts to feel like she is also divided into two people. To her father, she is Emma. But to her new family, she is Saylor, the name her mother always called her. Then there&#39;s Roo, the boy who was her very best friend when she was little.

She lives with her family in South Florida with a yard full of palm trees that get wrapped in colourful Christmas lights every winter.PreSchool-Grade 1-This follow-up to I Love You, Stinky Face (BridgeWater, 1997) continues in the tradition of innumerable stories in which a mother comforts her child's fears, but with a goofy twist. As with the first book, there is little sense of sentimentality, as Mama tries to allay her youngster's misgivings. The story begins with a concern that too many kids will get on the school bus, causing the tires to go flat. From there, the situations grow increasingly preposterous, such as what if the principal is "-really a witch-And she turned me into a snarly werewolf in polka dot underwear-?" McCourt does nothing new with this now-familiar story format but just goes for the easy laughs instead. Still, the silliness does provide Moore the opportunity to draw lots of entertainingly funny pictures. Her lively cartoon style is perfect for the over-the-top scenarios described in the text. Young readers may smile at Stinky Face's wacky imaginings, but this book has nothing to make it an enduring favorite.<br><i>Tim Wadham, Maricopa County Library District, Phoenix, AZ </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flying Finish</h2><p><p>When amateur jockey and pilot Lord Henry Grey launches himself into a career in the bloodstock market, he finds more danger and excitement than he&#x2019;d ever anticipated.</p><p>Henry immediately takes to his glittering new world and, when he meets the glamorous Gabriella in Italy, is sure he&#x2019;s hit the good life.

The book&#39;s chapters follow the progression from the mining era of the late 1800s and the quiet era that followed, through the early ski period and building of a strong cultural base, to the boom of the sixties and the growth and politics that followed into a new century.</p><p>I have read this book many times and have edited it as the publisher and editor. This is the most complete history of Aspen available and has been a best seller for 10 years in the Aspen area. The new edition brings the tale of Aspen, one of the most unique towns in the U.S., up to the new century, and shows with even more detail how the town arrived at its current place in the sun, and what the cost has been.Aspen, Colorado, where miners once covered the surrounding mountains searching for silver, is now world-famous as a ski resort and a cultural and intellectual center. In mining days, the town's citizens strapped on twelve-foot Norwegian snowshoes to get around in the winter. Many of the residents concentrated on the more civilized aspects of life, while others looked for riches. Years later, these riches were found in the snow that covered mine-pocked Aspen Mountain. At the same time, many of the elite from the East and Midwest created a cultural haven as they pursued the fulfillment of their dreams in this progressive Rocky Mountain town. The freethinking, independent nature of the citizens of Aspen has not changed, and the Aspen of today remains a vital, trend-setting community. <p>A History of Aspen recounts the saga of Aspen and the role of its leading citizens as Aspen roller-coasted from a thriving mining town and Colorado's third largest city, through a period of quiet, to its current place in the sun.</p></p><h2>Isaiah Berlin: a life</h2><p>356p large cloth with dustjacket, frontispiece, notes, index, photographic plates, as new, very good and fresh clean copy</p><p>Russian by birth, Jewish by descent, English by choice, Isaiah Berlin (1909-97) knit together three identities into a cosmopolitan sensibility that informed his contributions as one of the 20th century's most influential and important intellectuals. Based on his experiences as a child during the Russian Revolution and his friendships with such beleaguered writers as Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova, Berlin affirmed the superiority of individual freedom and judgment to Marxist totalitarianism. But he made fellow liberals uncomfortable with his unwelcome reminders that their ideals--liberty, equality, social justice--inevitably conflicted and required painful tradeoffs. London-based journalist Michael Ignatieff, who spent 10 years interviewing Berlin before his death, adeptly captures an appealing man: lighthearted, spontaneous, a brilliant conversationalist and lecturer (one of Oxford University's most popular professors), able to savor private happiness despite an essentially tragic view of political life. Ignatieff admires Berlin's views without accepting them uncritically; similarly, he acknowledges personal failings while appreciating the serenity Berlin achieved against considerable odds. This lucidly written, thoughtfully argued work is a model of the well-balanced biography, carefully evaluating the complex interplay of character and conviction in one remarkable individual. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Michael Ignatieff is a regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker </i>and T<i>he New York Review of Books</i>.

The quintessential edition for all fans of this powerfully moving book.<br><br></p><p>Since the beginning of the school year, high school freshman Melinda has found that it's been getting harder and harder for her to speak out loud: "My throat is always sore, my lips raw.... Every time I try to talk to my parents or a teacher, I sputter or freeze.... It's like I have some kind of spastic laryngitis." What could have caused Melinda to suddenly fall mute? Could it be due to the fact that no one at school is speaking to her because she called the cops and got everyone busted at the seniors' big end-of-summer party? Or maybe it's because her parents' only form of communication is Post-It notes written on their way out the door to their nine-to-whenever jobs. While Melinda is bothered by these things, deep down she knows the real reason why she's been struck mute...<p> Laurie Halse Anderson's first novel is a stunning and sympathetic tribute to the teenage outcast. The triumphant ending, in which Melinda finds her voice, is cause for cheering (while many readers might also shed a tear or two). After reading <i>Speak</i>, it will be hard for any teen to look at the class scapegoat again without a measure of compassion and understanding for that person--who may be screaming beneath the silence.

When the name came back to him, the images he had so admired vanished from his mind's eye. This is known as the "Signorelli parapraxis" in the annals of Freudian psychoanalysis and is a famous example from Freud's own life of his principle of repressed memory. What was at the bottom of this? There have been many theories on the subject, but Nicholas Fox Weber is the first to study the actual Signorelli frescoes for clues.</p><p>What Weber finds in these extraordinary Renaissance paintings provides unexpected insight into this famously confounding incident in Freud's biography.

Kass is a Professor in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago and Hertog Fellow in Social Thought at the American Enterprise Institute. Among his books are "Toward a more natural Science: Biology and Human Affairs;" The Hungry Soul;" The Ethics of Human Cloning (with James Q. Wilson);" and "Wing to wing, Oar to Oar: Readings on Courting and Marrying" (with Amy A. Kass). In 2001, President Bush Appointed Dr. Kass to chair the new President&#x2019;s Council on Bioethics.Leon Kass is the Addie Clark Harding Professor on the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago and a founding fellow of the Hastings Center, the nation's first bioethics research center. Given these credentials, when Kass speaks, we should listen, particularly since August 2001, when President George W. Bush appointed him to chair the President's Council on Bioethics. It is not that one expects the administration to turn to this council for moral advice, but rather that Kass was chosen to vet its membership to ensure its compatibility with the President's political stands on the matters submitted to it -- most notably, on the propriety of stem-cell research. Thus, Kass's Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity is not merely another theoretical disquisition on bioethics but, rather, in my opinion, expresses the administration's likely positions on issues central to medicine and medical research. For that reason alone, it warrants close reading. What one discovers is disquieting. This is what Kass asserts about moral life in the United States and the role of science in its decay: It is hard to claim respect for human life in the laboratory in a society that does not respect human life in the womb. It is hard to talk about the meaning of sexuality and embodiment in a culture that treats sex increasingly as a sport and has trivialized gender, marriage, and procreation. It is hard to oppose federal funding of baby-making in a society that increasingly expects the federal government to satisfy all demands, that -- contrary to so much evidence of waste, incompetence, and corruption -- continues to believe that only Uncle Sam can do it. During the past few decades, we have heard claims of a right to health or health care, a right to education or employment, a right to privacy (embracing also a right to abort or to enjoy pornography, or to commit suicide or sodomy), a right to dance naked, a right to clean air, a right to be born, even a right not to have been born. In this atmosphere, we hear much about the ultimate rights claim, a "right to die." How persuasive are these allegations? The waste, incompetence, and corruption that brought us Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco occurred in the private, not the public, sector and arose from lack of government regulation. Right-to-lifers (professing reverence for life in the womb), not laboratory scientists, have assassinated physicians and health workers. Church officers, not federal officials or biologists, have covered up for pedophiles. Our society is imperfect, but most Americans are remarkably decent folks. Why, according to Kass, has the quality of moral life deteriorated to such an extent? His book traces the "dehumanization" to the very ideology of biologic science, not merely its techniques: The deepest threat to human dignity lies not in the techniques of biotechnology but in the underlying science itself, in an "objectified" treatment of life that fails to do justice to its subject. The sciences not only fail to provide their own standards for human conduct; their findings cause us to doubt the truth and the ground of those standards we have held and, more or less, still tacitly hold. The challenge goes even further than the notorious case of evolution versus Biblical religion. Is there any elevated view of human life and goodness that is proof against the belief that man is just a collection of molecules, an accident on the stage of evolution? . . . Does not the scientific world view make us skeptical about the existence of any natural rights and therefore doubtful of the wisdom of those who've risked their all to defend them? If survival and pleasure are the only possible principles that nature does not seem to reject, does not all courage and devotion to honor look like folly? . . . We are quite frankly adrift without a compass. Can contemporary bioethics save us? Not a chance. Its theories, based on analytic philosophy, are "hyper-rational." The bioethicist Kass most admires is the late Paul Ramsey, professor of Christian ethics at Princeton, whose principles were based on religious faith. But to build on faith in a pluralistic society is to build on sand. As John Locke noted four centuries ago, "Every church is orthodox to itself; to others, erroneous or heretical." Kass's book dismisses the rationalists who disguise themselves as bioethicists in these woeful times of ours: "Expert" professors of ethics or bioethics are . . . unequal to these tasks. They are tasks, rather, for families and for communities of worship, where cultural practices enable the deepest insights of the mind to become embodied in the finest habits of the heart. Not for nothing does the Good Book say that the beginning of wisdom is the fear [awe, reverence] of the Lord. The theoretical and rationalistic approach to ethics has grave weaknesses. . . . Though originally intended to improve our deeds, the reigning practice of ethics, if truth be told, has, at best, improved our speech. Would that it had improved speech! Language is not neutral; words have connotations. Labeling stem-cell research "human cloning" summons images of scientific Frankensteins creating monsters. Call the process "nuclear transfer" (introduction of the nucleus of an adult somatic cell into an enucleated egg allowed to multiply for no more than 14 days), and the project will hardly raise an eyebrow. Label it "stem-cell research," recall that the 100,000 or more fertilized eggs now in a frozen limbo are slated for destruction, and compassion urges their use for research to combat degenerative diseases. Kass insists that he is not a Luddite. Notwithstanding his disavowal, what other than a Luddite should we call a man who would ban not only stem-cell research, but also reproductive medicine itself? He writes: even the benevolent uses of humanitarian technologies often have serious unintended and undesired consequences. . . . The ability to intervene technologically in the human body and mind brings vexing dilemmas, anxious fears and sorrowful consequences -- about abortion, genetic manipulation, organ transplantation, euthanasia, and use and abuse of drugs and worst of all . . . the conquest of nature for the relief of man's estate could lead to severe dehumanization -- in C.S. Lewis's words, to "the abolition of man." We learn to prevent all genetic disease, but only by turning procreation into manufacture. We have safe and shame-free sex, but little romance or lasting intimacy. We live much longer, but can't remember why we wanted to. Kass professes to "sympathize with the plight of infertile couples," but it is difficult to discern anything resembling sympathy in his moral fulminations about extracorporeal fertilization: Any honest biologist . . . must be inclined, at least on first glance, to the view that a human life begins at fertilization. . . . The most sensible policy is to treat the early embryo as a pre-viable fetus, with constraints imposed on early embryo research at least as great as those on fetal research. . . . The need for a respectable boundary defining protectable human life cannot be overstated. The current boundaries, gerrymandered for the sake of abortion -- namely, birth or viability -- may now satisfy both women's liberation and the United States Supreme Court and may someday satisfy even a future pope, but they will not survive the coming of more sophisticated technologies for growing life in the laboratory. "Gerrymandering" by the Supreme Court has reduced the rate of death from abortion by 90 percent during the past two decades. Human lives outside the womb are less important to this philosopher than the Court's lack of precision about the boundaries of viability. He goes on to lament in vitro fertilization: "What is the significance of divorcing human generation from human sexuality, precisely for the meaning of our bodily natures as male and female, as both gendered and engendering?" As much as a third of infertility, Kass tells us, results from tubal obstruction secondary to gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease. This belief leads to a savage comment: leaving aside any question about whether it makes sense for a federally-funded baby to be the wage of aphrodisiac indiscretion, one can only look with wonder at a society that would have Petri dish babies before it has found a vaccine against gonorrhea. . . . Much as I sympathize with the plight of infertile couples, I do not believe they are entitled to the provision of a child at public expense, especially now, especially at this cost, especially by a procedure that involves also so many moral difficulties. Kass then adds, with disgust: "A few years ago an egalitarian Boston-based group concerned with infertility managed to obtain private funding to pay for artificial insemination for women on welfare!" If Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity were simply another jeremiad about the decline of morality, there would be little reason for concern; as a blueprint for federal policy, it is alarming. It is not accidental that "the pursuit of happiness" is not to be found in the book's title: Kass elevates suffering to a moral virtue. Where moral analysis is called for, he provides moral exhortation. We are given cant, not Kant. <i>Leon Eisenberg, M.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

That is how Jefferson saw the election of 1800&#x2014;and the lessons for today couldn&#x2019;t be more obvious. <br><br> Most historians celebrate Jefferson&#x2019;s victory over Adams in 1800 as the beginning of the two-party system, but Jefferson would have been horrified by this interpretation. Drawing on the understanding of faction, revolution, and conspiracy reflected in the writings of the Founders, Sisson makes it clear that they, like Jefferson, envisioned essentially a nonparty state.<br><br> Jefferson believed his election was a peaceful revolution by the American people overturning an elitist faction that was stamping out cherished constitutional rights and trying to transform our young democracy into an authoritarian state. It was a transfer of power back to the people, not a change of parties. Sisson maintains Jefferson would regard our current two-party system as a repudiation of his theory of revolution and his earnest desire that the people as a whole, not any faction or clique, would triumph in government.

Brancusi's influence can be seen in a wide range of Western sculptors, including Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Henry Moore, Jean Arp, Barbara Hepworth, Minimalists and land artists. This new book studies the religious and mythical dimensions of Constantin Brancusi's distinctive scultpural forms, the 'eggs', 'fishes', 'heads' and 'columns'. His central quest was for the 'essence of things', which resulted in purifying a form until only the essence was left. It was Constantin Brancusi's project to strip away the detritus that had accumulated around sculpture, Henry Moore said, and to offer the pure, simple shape. What Brancusi did was 'to concentrate on very simple shapes, to keep his sculpture, as it were, one-cylindered, to refine and polish a single shape to a degree almost too precious.' As well as being a sculptor, Constantin Brancusi was also an accomplished photographer. Quite a few artists (not all of them sculptors) have expressed &nbsp;for Brancusi's photographs, and the way he would set up his sculptures in&nbsp;his studio and photograph them at particular times of the day, when the lighting&nbsp;was just right. They are early examples of installation art (and some of the best, too). Andy Goldsworthy said he admired how Brancusi created the right conditions in his studio so that his work 'comes alive at a particular time of the day as the light momentarily touches it'. For Goldsworthy, Brancusi's works were at their best when they were arranged by the sculptor in his studio and photographed. Somehow, it wasn't quite the same when they were displayed in modern art museums (such as the Pompidou Centre in Paris or the Museum of Modern Art in Gotham, which have important Brancusi pieces). Fully illustrated, including many photos of Constantin Brancusi's studio in Paris, Brancusi&#x2019;s works in museums in New York, Washington and L.A., forerunners and influences, prehistoric art, and the art of his contemporaries. With bibliography and notes. ISBN 9781861714343. 180 pages. This new (5th) edition has been revised. www.crmoon.com AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE: The art of Constantin Brancusi never ceases to fascinate and inspire, and it always seems fresh, as if it had been created fives minutes ago, no matter how many times you look at it. When you encounter a Brancusi sculpture in a museum, it pops out, clear and direct; there is simply nothing else like Brancusi&#x2019;s art in history. I have tried to explore the key elements of Brancusi&#x2019;s art, and the important events in his development as a sculptor. I have also included comparisons with other artists of the period, and also how Brancusi&#x2019;s art has influenced many subsequent artists.</p><p></p><h2>B-52G/H Stratofortress In Action</h2><p>More than any other weapon system, the legendary Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is the embodiment of US military power. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the B-52 has been its longevity. It first flew in 1952 and entered operational service with the US Air Force in 1955. Boeing delivered the last B-52 in 1962. Five decades later, the B-52 remains in front-line service, most recently taking part in combat over Afghanistan and Iraq. Even more amazingly, current plans are for the B-52 to remain in service until 2040. This volume is packed with historical and recent photographs of the B-52, including some that were released by the US Air Force and its contractors just for use in the book. As part of his research, the author flew on a B-52 training mission, and the flight report in this volume is the most detailed description of a B-52 mission ever published.</p><p></p><h2>Uniforms and Insignia of the Navies of World War II</h2><p>Based upon the U.

His account is at once romantic and packed with facts, conjuring up the atmosphere of the canals, bridges and sunlit squares, the churches and the markets, the fiestas and the flowers. He leads us through the history of the city, from the first refugees arrivingin the mists of the lagoon in the fourth century to the rise of a great mercantile state and a trading empire, the wars against Napoleon and the tourist invasions of today.<br><br>Everything is here: the merchants on the Rialto and the Jews in the ghetto; the mosaics of St Mark's and the glass blowers of Murano; the carnival masks and the sad colonies of lepers; the doges and the destitute and the artists with their passion for colour and form -- Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo. There are wars and sieges, scandals and seductions, fountains playing in deserted squares and crowds thronging the markets. And there is a dark undertone too, of shadowy corners and dead ends, prisons and punishment.<br><br>The language and way of thinking of the Venetians sets them aside from the rest of Italy. They are an island people, linked to the sea and to the tides rather than the land. 'The moon rules Venice,' Ackroyd writes: 'It is built on ocean shells and ocean ground; it has the aspect of infinity. It is the floating world... changing and variable and accidental.'This book, like a magic gondola, transports its readers to that sensual, surprising realm. We could have no better guide -- reading Ackroyd's <b>Venice</b> is, in itself, a glorious journey and the perfect holiday.</p><p>PETER ACKROYD is an award-winning novelist, as well as a broadcaster, biographer, poet and historian.

They were exiles, far from their own cities or farms, fleeing from the marauding tribes of the North and the East. And they had come to this wild place, a wide and flat lagoon in which fresh water from the rivers on the mainland and salt water from the Adriatic mingled. At low tide there were mud-flats all around, cut through with streams and rivulets and small channels; at high tide there were small islands of silt and marsh-grass. There were shoals covered with reeds and wild grasses, rising just a little way above the waters. There were patches of land that were generally submerged but, at certain low tides, rose above the water. There were desolate marshes that the water only rarely covered. The salt marshes and the shore seemed from a distance to make up the same wide expanse, marked with ponds and islets. There were swamps here, too, as dark and uninviting as the waters that the tide did not reach. A line of islands, made up of sand and river debris, helped to protect the lagoon from the sea; these were covered with pine woods.<br><br>Although the lagoon was not far from the once great centres of Roman civilisation, it was remote and secluded. This was a solitary place, its silence broken only by the calls of the seabirds and the crash of the billows of the sea and the sound of the wind soughing in the rushes. At night it was the setting of a vast darkness, except in those patches where the moon illumined the restless waters. Yet in the daylight of the exiles' approach the silver sea stretched out into a line of mist, and the cloudy sky seemed to reflect the silvery motions of the water. They were drawn into a womb of light. They found an island. And a voice, like the sound of many waters, told them to build a church on the ground they had found. This is one of the stories of origin that the Venetians told.<br><br>The lagoon itself is an ambiguous area that is neither land nor sea. It is approximately thirty-five miles (56 km) in length and seven miles (11 km) in width, taking a crescent shape along part of the coast of north-eastern Italy. It was created some six thousand years ago, emerging from the mud and silt and debris that came down into the Adriatic from seven rivers. The principal among them--the rivers Brenta, Sile and Piave--carried material from the Alps and the Apennines; a city of stone would one day rise on the minute debris of mountains. The swamps and marshes and mud-flats are protected from the sea by a long and narrow bank of sand, divided into islands by several channels; the longest of those islands is now known as the Lido. The channels make openings in the barrier, entrances known as porti, through which the sea rushes into the lagoon. There are now three such porti at the Lido, at Malamocco and at Chioggia. These tides breathe life into Venice.<br><br>It is a continually various and unsettled scene, part mud and part sand and part clay; it is changed by tides, always shifting and unstable. There is a current in the Adriatic that flows up and down from the Mediterranean, and each of the porti creates its own distinct basin or force of water. That is why the appearance of the lagoon has altered over the centuries. There is one theory that, as late as the sixth and seventh centuries, the lagoon was essentially a marsh covered by water at high tide. In the nineteenth century, according to John Ruskin, there were times at low tide when it seemed that Venice was marooned on a vast plain of dark green seaweed. The whole lagoon in fact would have become dry land five hundred years ago, were it not for the intervention of the Venetians themselves. The lagoon is now simply another part of Venice, another quarter that happens to be neither land nor sea. But it is slowly returning to the sea. The waters are growing deeper, and more salty. It is a precarious place. Saint Christopher, carrying the infant Christ across the water, was once a popular saint of the city.<br><br>There have always been inhabitants of the lagoon. The wilderness could, after all, be fruitful. From the earliest times there were small pockets of people--fishermen and fowlers ready to take advantage of the abundance of wildfowl and marine life as well as the autumnal migration of the fish from the rivers to the sea. The marshes are also a natural place for the harvesting of salt. Salt was a valuable commodity. The Venetians were always known as a mercantile people, but the first stirrings of trade in this area began even before their ancestors had arrived.<br><br>The earliest tribes are lost in the darkness of prehistory. But the first recognisable ancestors of the Venetians inhabited the region surrounding the lagoon from the eighth century bc. These were the people who dwelled in the north-eastern part of Italy as well as along the coasts of what are now Slovenia and Croatia. They were known as the Veneti or the Venetkens; Homer refers to them as the "Enetoi," because there is no "v" sound in classical Greek. They were primarily merchants, as the Venetians would become, trading in amber and wax, honey and cheese. They set up great markets, like those which the Venetians eventually established. They traded with Greece, just as Venice would one day trade with Byzantium and the East. They specialised in the extraction of salt from coastal areas, in a way that anticipates the Venetian monopoly of salt production.<br><br>They dressed in black, which became the colour characteristically worn by patrician Venetian males. Hercules was the tribal hero of the Veneti, and became a legendary protector of Venice; he is the demi-god who acquires by labour what others claim by right. The Veneti traced their descent from Antenor, who led them from the ruined city of Troy. They were well known for their skill in seamanship, and were essentially a maritime people. They submitted, in marital and familial matters, to the authority of the state. These were the people who inhabited cities such as Padua and Altino, Aquileia and Grado. These were the exiles who came for safety to the waters of the lagoon.<br><br>Before the time of flight, the Veneti were thoroughly Romanised. By the second century ad they had made a pact with the powers of Rome. In the reign of Augustus the area of the lagoon was part of the Tenth District of Italy and then in the fourth century it became part of the eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire. The lagoon was already partly settled. On one of the islands, S. Francesco del Deserto, have been found the remains of a Roman port with pottery from the first century and wall plaster of the third century.<br><br>The port was no doubt used by those vessels sailing between Aquileia and Ravenna, bearing grain from Pannonia as well as goods and supplies from more distant shores. Amphorae have been discovered here, for the carriage of wine and olive oil that had come from the eastern Mediterranean. The larger ships would dock on the island, their goods then transported to smaller ships for the shallows of the lagoon. There must have been local pilots, therefore, to guide the craft through these exiguous waters. A walkway, dating to the second century ad, has been found beneath the nave of the basilica of S. Maria Assunta on the island of Torcello. Roman remains have been found at a great depth on the island of S. Giorgio Maggiore, and material from the first and second centuries has been discovered on smaller islands. Other finds, on other islands, can be dated from the fourth to the seventh centuries. It has been suggested that the outer islands of the lagoon could have been used as a station for the Roman fleet; it is conceivable, to say no more, that villas were constructed here.<br><br>Yet there was a fundamental change in the nature of the lagoon when the exiles from the mainland began to arrive in larger and larger numbers. There was no central exodus, but rather successive waves of migration that culminated in the late sixth century. The Veneti were escaping from invaders. In 403 Alaric the Visigoth descended upon the province of Venetia; in the words of Claudian, the historian of Rome, "fame proclaimed the march of the barbarian, and filled the land with terror." Aquileia and Verona fell, with many of their inhabitants fleeing to the safety of the islands. When the threat of Alaric had passed, some returned home. But others stayed, making a new life in the lagoon. In 446 Attila gained Roman provinces from the Danube to the Balkans and then, six years later, took Aquileia; Altino and Padua were also sacked. Once more the refugees from these disasters fled to the lagoon.<br><br>There was a pattern to their movement. The people of Altino migrated to Torcello and Burano, for example, while those from Treviso went to Rialto and Malamocco. The inhabitants of Padua sailed to Chioggia. The citizens of Aquileia moved to Grado, which was itself protected by marshes. They came with craftsmen and builders, with farmers and labourers, with patricians and plebeians; they came with the sacred vessels from their churches, and even with the stones of their public buildings so that they might build anew. But how could they build on such shifting ground? How could they build upon mud and water? It was possible, however, for wooden poles of from ten to a dozen feet in length to be sunk into the mud before reaching a layer of harder clay and dense sand that acted as a firm foundation. This was the "boundary" at the bottom of the lagoon. So there sprang up small houses known as casoni made from the wood of poles and boards, with pitched roofs of wattle and reed.<br><br>New towns, such as Heraclea and Equilio (Jesolo), were founded by the edge of the lagoon. On the islands were established village communities, with leaders consulting assemblies of the people. The Veneti may also have set up fortified encampments, in the event that the Huns or Goths decided to move against them. But the islanders were fractious and competitive; there was no unity in the lagoons. So in 466, just twenty years after the appearance of Attila, a meeting of all the Veneti of the lagoon was held at Grado. It was decided that each island would be represented by a tribune, and that the tribunes would then work together for the common good. They were, after all, facing the same dangers and difficulties--not least from the depredations of the sea. This was the first sign of the public and communal spirit that would one day manifest itself so clearly in Venice itself.<br><br>The Veneti were by the sixth century a defined presence in the region. They were paid to ferry people and goods between the ports and harbours of the mainland. They transported the soldiers of Byzantium from Grado to the river Brenta. They carried officials and merchants to Byzantium itself. Already they were known for their maritime skills. Their boats travelled up the rivers of northern Italy, trading salt and fish to the cities and villages en route.<br><br>The first description of these island people comes in a letter sent in 523 to their tribunes by a legate from the Ostrogoth kingdom then prevailing in northern Italy. Cassiodorus was asking them to transport wine and oil across the waters to Ravenna. "For you live like seabirds," he wrote, "with your homes dispersed, like the Cyclades, across the surface of the water. The solidity of the earth on which they rest is secured only by osier and wattle; yet you do not hesitate to oppose so frail a bulwark to the wildness of the sea." He was not quite accurate in his description; there were already some houses constructed from the stone and brick of the mainland. He went on to say that the Veneti "have one great wealth--the fish which suffices for you all. Among you there is no difference between rich and poor; your food is the same, your houses are all alike." Again, this was not quite true. Extant testimonials suggest that, even at an early stage in the development of the lagoon, there were rich as well as poor families. Cassiodorus then added that "your energies are spent on your salt fields; in them indeed lies your prosperity." In this, at least, he was right. And he added the significant detail of "your boats--which like horses you keep tied up at the doors of your dwellings." By good fortune one of these boats has emerged from the mud of the lagoon. Part of a rib of oak, and a hull of lime, have been found on the island of S. Francesco del Deserto; the boat itself dates to the fifth century. It was lying at a level that, in this period, would have been submerged except at times of low tide.<br><br>Yet Venice itself was not yet born. It is not shown in a fourth-century map of the region, in which the lagoon is depicted as a sea route without people. Venetian historians claimed, however, that the city was established at midday on 25 March 421, by a poor fisherman known as Giovanni Bono or John the Good. There are advantages to this theory, since the same date has been given to the vernal equinox, the Annunciation and the supposed date of the foundation of Rome. The triple coincidence, as well as the provident arrival of John the Good, is too good to be true; but it is part of the extraordinary Venetian ability to supplant history with myth. As the German poet, Rilke, said on a visit to the city in 1920, "as with mirrors one grasps nothing but is only drawn into the secret of its elusiveness. One is filled with images all day long, but could not substantiate a single one of them. Venice is a matter of faith."<br><br>In fact Venice emerged over a century later, after a series of invasions by the Lombards in the late 560s and early 570s. Once more the province of Venetia was overcome by alien tribes. Unlike the Huns, however, they did not wish to plunder and depart. They intended to stay and to settle. They overran what is now called in their name the region of Lombardy. Their arrival prompted a mass exodus of the Veneti. The bishop of Aquileia moved his see to the edge of the lagoon at Grado. The bishop of Padua removed himself to Malamocco, and the bishop of Oderzo sailed to Heraclea. These men were secular as well as religious leaders; they took citizens as well as congregations, ready to create new communities on the water. Burano and Murano were extensively settled, as well as smaller islands such as Ammiana and Constanziaca; these last two disappeared beneath the waves in the thirteenth century, swallowed up by the main enemy of the island people. They have never rested in their battle against the sea.<br><br>Venice was born in this flight from the Lombards. The most recent archaeological investigations have dated the first signs of human habitation to the second half of the sixth century and to the seventh century; these remains were situated in the neighbourhood of Castello, in the east of the city, and beneath Saint Mark's Square. There is evidence, too, that in these early years work had already begun on raising the surface of the land and reclaiming earth from water. The settlers fenced the soil with planks and poles; they drained the water; they laid down building rubble, or sediment, or sand from the dunes; they erected wooden palisades to resist the sea. It is the beginning of the city.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Forty-Eight Minutes: A Night in the Life of the NBA</h2><p>This study of a game between the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers provides an in-depth look at the plays, the players, the strategies--and the business concerns behind them all--in the world of professional basketball</p><p>Two writers covering the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics join in a close look at the teams' 1987 Boston Garden game.

Skinner tells her of Flint's death, but Sora feels that he carries part of Flint's soul inside him. When Skinner reveals secrets that only Flint would know, and rouses her passion in ways only Flint had, Sora must figure out if this is the clever witchcraft of enemies who want to seize her power and destroy her nation, or the spirit of her one and only true love.</p></p><p><p><b>KATHLEEN O'NEAL GEAR</b> is a former state historian and archaeologist for Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska for the U.S. Department of the Interior.

They had their gazes on the field, watching the game play out.As Chieftess Sora ran down the field after the chunkey stone, she didn't recognize War Chief Skinner, not at first. All she saw was a muscular man brushing webs from his long black hair as he walked through the shadows of the mounds. A massive chert war club hung from his belt, and he had a bow and quiver over his left shoulder. He used his spear as a walking stick.Warriors unconsciously placed their hands on belted stilettos as Skinner passed by, while women turned to stare admiringly at the stranger dressed in a war chief's raiding garb. His knee-length buckskin shirt was plain, except for the shark's teeth sewn across the front and the red buffalo-wool sash that belted his trim waist.As she neared the throwing line, Sora called, "Your cast or mine, Wink?"Fifty paces ahead of her, the chunkey stone, round and about the width of her hand, rolled like the wind."My cast!" Matron Wink shouted from her right. When her foot hit the casting line, she launched her spear. Thirty-six winters had passed since Wink's birth. More gray than black shimmered in her long braid, and wrinkles incised laugh lines around her ample mouth. Her given name, the name bestowed upon her at her initiation in the woman's house, was Marsh Wren, but she'd had a bad habit of winking at people. The nickname had stuck like boiled pine pitch.Wink's spear arced upward, and hundreds of onlookers made awed sounds. One of the opposing headmen reached the casting line and hurled his spear. For a deadly serious game, the rules of chunkey were relatively simple. Whoever hit the stone earned two points. Whoever's spear landed closest to the stone earned one point. They played three games, each to a score of six.Sora slowed to watch the two spears sailing toward the rolling chunkey stone. Her white dress, made from combed palmetto threads, fluttered in the wind.Wink stopped beside Sora, breathing hard. Though Sora was four winters younger, they'd been friends since childhood. While Sora had ascended to the chieftainship, Wink had become matron of their Shadow Rock Clan. They both wore elaborately incised copper breastplates that signified their status. Sometimes she thought she knew Wink better than she knew herself. The reverse was certainly true."That's Chief Short Tail's spear right behind yours," Sora said.Wink glanced at Short Tail and Pocket Mouse. Both chiefs wore red knee-length shirts decorated with shells from the far western ocean. "I know. I saw the moron cast."Sora suppressed a smile. Wink's candor was legendary--though few people appreciated it. In fact, most of the other matrons and chiefs heartily disliked her because of it.Wink groaned when the heavy stone slowed and fell onto itsside just before the spears landed. Almost at the same time, her spear lodged in the ground a good pace from the stone. Chief Short Tail's spear landed ahead, but it looked to be about the same distance away."Oh, gods, what do you think?" Wink asked."I can't tell."As the judges trotted out to see who had scored, Sora's heartbeat quickened and her head grew light. People shoved to the very edge of the field, trying to get a better look.Sora whispered, "If you scored, we win, and it's over. If not ...""If not"--Wink inhaled a deep breath and let it out in a rush--"we have one more cast to stop a war that will surely destroy our people."One of the judges, old Club-in-His-Hand, pulled a coil of twine from his belt. The other judge, the young warrior Far Eye, held the end of the cord against the stone while Club-in-His-Hand extended it out to Short Tail's spear point. They made an odd pair. Club-in-His-Hand was short, with a full head of gray hair, while Far Eye was tall and lean. Tattoos covered every part of his body. His long black hair hung to the middle of his back. Wink called him her nephew, though that wasn't technically true. Wink's brother had married a woman from the Water Hickory Clan, and since the Black Falcon Nation traced descent through the female, that meant Far Eye was really Water Hickory Clan, not Shadow Rock Clan. But Wink loved the youth as if he were her own nephew.Hisses of disapproval went up from Sora's side as the judges lifted the twine for the audience to see the measurement. Short Tail's people remained silent, gazing wide-eyed at Wink's spear. They seemed to be holding their breaths. On the sidelines, warriors marched back and forth, eyes blazing.As the judges moved to measure Wink's cast, Sora's gaze drifted around Blackbird Town.Four of the great flat-topped mounds rose directly in front of her. The largest, upon which her magnificent pitched-roof homestood, was six times the height of a man and measured one hundred paces along each side of its square base. To her left, the crystal green water of Persimmon Lake glistened. In the winter, when everyone returned from their summer farming plots, the population of Blackbird Town swelled to almost one thousand. Two hundred small houses, the homes of commoners, ringed the shore. Animal bones covered the roofs like glistening white sticks. The bones of animals caught in snares or traps were never thrown away, but respectfully hung up or placed on the roof of the hunter's house. If this ceremony was not followed, the trap would become useless because the Spirits of the animals would be offended and their relatives would refuse to allow themselves to be caught."Please, Skyholder," Wink murmured to the Creator, "for the sake of everyone, let us win.""What's taking so long?" Sora asked.Wink shook her head. "The casts are too close; they're measuring each again."Chunkey games were sacred contests where the players represented the primordial heroes of creation: the forces of Light and Dark, Peace and War, Female and Male. Villages routinely wagered everything they owned on the outcome of a game, but this was more. They played to decide a tie vote in the High Council. If Shadow Rock Clan won, there would be peace. If Water Hickory Clan won, they would be at war tomorrow. The Loon People, east of the Palmetto River, would fall like autumn leaves before the warriors of the Black Falcon Nation.Wink made a small sound of dismay just before riotous cheers went up from Short Tail's side of the field. The judges held the two lengths of cord side by side, showing that Short Tail's cast had been closer, by a finger's length, to the chunkey stone."We're tied. The next point will determine the game."Wink shook sweat-soaked strands of graying black hair away from her face. "If we're lucky Short Tail's manhood will wither and fall off before he can cast again."Sora gave her a peeved look. "Don't you think it would be more practical to wish that his hand fell off so he couldn't throw accurately, or maybe his feet, so he couldn't run so fast?""Don't be ridiculous. He has the souls of a thirteen-winters-old boy. His manhood is his entire world. Crush it and you crush him." Wink calmly straightened her enormous engraved copper breastplate; it gleamed against her white dress. She gestured to Short Tail. "Look at him. Can you believe that man has seen thirty-eight winters?"Chief Short Tail jumped up and down like an exultant child, slapping his teammate, Chief Pocket Mouse, on the shoulder and whooping, much to the delight of his kinspeople, who roared their approval.Club-in-His-Hand trotted down the field with the chunkey stone and gave it to Sora."It's your roll, Chieftess," he whispered, and desperately glanced around. "Make it a good one."Sora nodded. "I'd better."She and Wink marched back to the starting line. While she waited for Short Tail and Pocket Mouse to finish their conversations, Sora's gaze moved down the field to where her husband, Rockfish, stood. He had been very handsome in his early days, tall and slender, with a triangular face and large dark eyes, but he'd started to show his sixty winters. His hair had gone completely gray, and his muscles had evaporated. Though he still carried out most of his husbandly duties--hunting, fishing, and advising her on clan matters--each was becoming more difficult for him. Their marriage had been one of convenience, an alliance of political advantage, but she genuinely cared for him. It worried her that his strength had begun to fail.They'd married three winters ago, after her first husband, Flint, set her belongings outside the door and headed home to his mother's village. The divorce had disgraced Sora. Not only that, she'd loved Flint. She'd made a fool of herself, running after him,begging him to return. When he'd shoved her away, she'd been consumed by despair. The simplest daily tasks, getting dressed or making a pot of tea, had seemed overwhelming.In response, her mother, High Chieftess Yellow Cypress, had selected Rockfish as her new husband. He came from a renowned family of Traders who lived far to the north. It had been a good choice--for both of them. Since her mother had no sons, and the chieftainship was a hereditary position destined for the eldest daughter, Sora had become chieftess after her mother's death two winters ago. What she gave Rockfish in prestige, he gave her in Trade goods. The day of their joining, a flotilla of canoes had appeared, filled to overflowing with rare cherts and mica, silver nuggets, pounded sheets of copper--and the Trade goods had never stopped coming. Every moon, another flotilla arrived. Rockfish was much older than she and knew things about people that she did not. Sora was often d...</p><h2>Law School for Everyone: Litigation and Legal Practice &amp; Criminal Law and Procedure - Transcript Book</h2><p>Receive a fundamental education in American law from four exceptional lawyers and professors.

To celebrate the life of Ansel Adams, this biography takes young readers through his rich life: from the earthquake that broke his nose to the valley that shaped his world, revealing the humorous, artistic, and thoughtful personality behind his legendary work.</p><p>Beverly Gherman has previously written children's biographies of Georgia O'Keeffe, Agnes de Mille, Sandra Day O'Connor, E.B.

It is illustrated by the works of Adams, the photographer who was able to capture the magnificence of nature on film. And the text keeps up with the pictures. Gherman provides a clear and insightful look into Adams' life, beginning with his childhood in San Francisco, following him as he becomes enamored with both photography and the piano, and detailing the long-range effects that growing up amid natural beauty had on him. Adams' life seems to have been free of any real crises, yet the narrative is never boring or dry. Readers being introduced to Adams' work for the first time will be awed by the photographs, and Adams' fans will appreciate both the numerous offerings and the book's handsome design. The volume's thick paper stock, an easy-to-read typeface, and high-quality reproduction make a fitting setting for Adams' works. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Included are his first piece for Town &amp; Country, "The Quiet Pleasures of Cognac and Cigars," as well as other gems from such publications as Travel and Leisure, Cuisine, Food &amp; Wine, and Esquire. Full of recipes, literate explications of the origins of ingredients and dishes, trenchant critiques of restaurants, and exhortations to excellence, Villas at Table is a cornucopia - well-seasoned with humor, style, and crankiness - whipped up with passion.<br>Villas, food and wine editor of Town &amp; Country , adores caviar and the late S.S. France , but also prizes M.F.K. Fisher's recipe for the perfect hamburger. Though fond of cognac, truffles and foie gras, the self-described "ultimate wine snob" salutes sardines, baked beans and bistros. His wide-ranging collection of 43 essays on his forays into food provides as many recipes as chapters, yet is not a cookbook. "I've yet to turn out . . . biscuits . . . that can equal Mother's fluffy wonders," mourns the author, but gives instructions "detailed enough to ensure reasonable success." Villas writes nostalgically of holiday meals and cooking traditions from his Greek-Swedish-Southern background, and candidly admits his dislike of la nouvelle cuisine ("the silly conceits of the so-called New American style of cooking") and of "young, inexperienced superstar chefs." His best pieceson country ham, scotch whiskey and the nirvana to be had at the Princess Grill aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 are travel pieces for the roving appetite. The less successful ones merely chat on about people, places and umpteen favorite dishes. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Feminine Mystique</h2><p>Published by W.W.

Leschak has been a firefighter in both wildland and municipal settings for more than twenty years. He's the author of several acclaimed works of nonfiction, including <i>Letters from Side Lake</i> and <i>The Bear Guardian,</i> winner of the Minnesota Book Award. Leschak has written for numerous periodicals, including <i>Harper's, the New York Times Magazine, the New York Times Book Review,</i> and <i>Outdoor Life.</i>What is it about their work that makes firefighters so devoted addicted, even to the calling? Leschak (Trial by Wildfire), a 20-year veteran wildfire fighter, attempts to answer this question in his contemplative memoir. He focuses primarily on the spring of 2000, when he led a helitack crew (a rapid-response helicopter unit) battling especially fierce and persistent wildfires in western Montana. That was also when Leschak discovered the diaries of Father Peter Pernin, a survivor of the 1871 fire that leveled Peshtigo, Wis. He threads the story of the Peshtigo fire throughout the book, along with other historical facts about American forest fires and the formation of a wildfire subculture. As he describes the dangers faced by his own team, the plainspoken, articulate Leschak explores the psychology and spirituality of fire fighting particularly the exhilaration of life-threatening situations citing sources as diverse as Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, William James and Walker Percy. Leschak had trained to become an evangelical minister in East Texas, and he recalls his conversion to evangelism at age 18, after listening to a radio preacher; his growing disillusionment with the narrow-mindedness of his Bible college; and his revelatory discovery of his true life's work. In spite of its prominence in the subtitle, the story of the Peshtigo fire is woven casually and sporadically into the book; those looking for a sustained history should turn to another book on the Peshtigo fire being publishing the same month (Firestorm at Peshtigo. Nonetheless, Leschak's action scenes crackle with energy, and his down-to-earth account of his spiritual quest should strike a chord with many.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Willow&#39;s Underwater World (Flower Fairies)</h2><p>Willow couldn&#x2019;t be happier than when she&#x2019;s frolicking by the stream.

David Dalton was a founding editor of Rolling Stone magazine and is the author of over ten fiction and non-fiction books, including James Dean: The Mutant King and El Sid: Saint Vicious. As teenagers he and his sister Sarah were Andy Warhol&#39;s first assistants. It is he who designed - with Warhol himself in 1964 - the &#39;Fab&#39; issue of the Aspen magazine.&#39;Now Andy Warhol fans get their first chance to own a photographic diary of his circle in the year 1964-65.&#39; (British Vogue) &#39;What you get is what you would expect: an inimitable record of a cultural icon in the process of inventing himself ... Text supplier David Dalton (himself a picture subject) suggests that Warhol didn&#39;t want the project published because he appeared more lively and spontaneous than his bland-faced self-iconising would permit; whatever the reason, we&#39;re lucky to have got them now.&#39; (Guardian)</p><h2>Fundamentals of Children&#39;s Services (Fundamentals Series)</h2><p>Children's services are the heart of the library; in fact, more than one-third of U.S. library users are under the age of 12.

The return of exiles is transforming the city, and through the lives of Didymus Maqoma, his wife Sibongile, and their lovely daughter who cannot even speak her parents&#39; African language, the reader experiences the strange passions, reversals, and dangers that accompany new-won access to power. All must change: Didymus, once a major actor in the resistance, making way for Sibongile&#39;s emergence as a political figure; Vera, working through the consequences of a lifetime&#39;s commitments to a new kind of relationship with a new man of the times, Zeph Rapulana.</p><p>A superb stylist, Nadine Gordimer has no need for polemic or finger-wagging. Firmly grounded in physical and psychological detail, memorably evoking the texture of daily life for South Africans of every stripe, her books have earned world-wide acclaim. In the words of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, "Gordimer... can not only capture but express in the lives of human beings those moments which are so fleeting, so impalpable, as well as so common that they are overlooked by all but a very rare artist."The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Lawrence and T.S. Eliot, and was championed by Pound, Robert McAlmon, Ford Madox Ford, and others.</p><p>Mary Butts fraternized with Hemingway, was courted by Virgil Thompson, and lived a wild life in the Paris of the 1920, where some in the modernist movement considered her a better writer than Katherine Mansfield. But Mary Butts is not a familiar literary name, and even during her own life, her writings remained obscure, spiraling further into oblivion following her premature death in 1937. Biographer Nathalie Blondel resurrects the forgotten life of Mary Butts in this rare biography. Butts's writings may have fallen into a literary no man's land, but her life story was luckily preserved through her meticulously written memoirs, letters, and the testaments from her better known acquaintances. Blondel allows these sources to speak for themselves in this biography. Butts is revealed as a highly complex and difficult woman who despised her mother, abandoned her child, and was obsessed with expensive art. She experimented with opium and was fascinated with the supernatural. This fascination is reflected in several of her works including the mythical short story collection <i>From Altar to Chimney-Piece</i>. Yet Butts's works never gained more than a small following. Blondel doesn't obsess over the "hows" and "whys" of Butts's failure to reach the same levels of literary notoriety as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. Yet it is Butts's image as a lost writer which remains with us. This is sad testament to an important literary figure.Nathalie Blondel was born in Stoke-on-Trent in 1960 and grew up in Colchester, Essex. She was educated at Colchester Girls&#39; High School and Liverpool University, where she completed a doctorate in 1989 on the fiction of Mary Butts and the American writer Jane Bowles. Subsequently she has edited three of Jane Bowles&#39;s unpublished stories in collaboration with Paul Bowles, and has worked as a writer and translator: her subjects have included Jean Cocteau, Arthur Symons, Frances Bellerby, Patrick Hamilton, and Jocelyn Brooke, as well as Mary Butts. Nathalie Blondel currently is Research Fellow in Modern Literature and Lecturer at Oxford Brookes.</p><h2>Screwed: The Undeclared War Against the Middle Class -- And What We Can Do About It</h2><p>Millions of working Americans talk, act, and vote as if their economic interests match those of the megawealthy, the multinational corporations, and the politicians who do their bidding. How did this happen? According to Air America radio host Thom Hartmann, the apologists of the Right have become masters of the subtle and largely subconscious aspects of political communication. It&#x2019;s not an escalation in Iraq, it&#x2019;s a surge; it&#x2019;s not the inheritance tax, it&#x2019;s the death tax; it&#x2019;s not drilling for oil, it&#x2019;s exploring for energy.<br><br> Conservatives didn&#x2019;t intuit the path to persuasive messaging&#x2014;they learned these techniques. There is no reason why progressives can&#x2019;t learn them too. In Cracking the Code, Hartmann shows you how. Drawing on his background as a psychotherapist and advertising executive as well as a national radio host, he breaks down the science and technology of effective communication so you can apply it to your own efforts to counter right-wing disinformation. It&#x2019;s both an art and a science&#x2014;as Hartmann explains, political persuasion is as much about biology as ideology, about knowing how the brain processes information and how that influences the way people perceive messages, make decisions, and form a worldview.<br><br> Throughout the book, Hartmann shows you precisely how to master this technology, providing examples dating back to the time of the Founding Fathers. As you read deeply in this book, you&#x2019;ll see things you hadn&#x2019;t realized were there&#x2014;in everything from advertising to political rants&#x2014;and discover abilities you didn&#x2019;t know you had. Whether you&#x2019;re a politician, an activist, a volunteer, or a concerned citizen, you&#x2019;ll develop a strong sense for how to reach into that part of the collective human psyche where we truly do have the power to create a new world.</p><p>Thom Hartmann is the host of a nationally syndicated Air America Radio program and is the author of eighteen books, including The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight: The Fate of the World and What We Can Do Before It&#x2019;s Too Late; We the People: A Call to Take Back America; What Would Jefferson Do?, and Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights.Profits before People<br><br> THE STORY OF CARL<br><br> Carl loved books and he loved history. After spending two years in the army as part of the American occupation forces in Japan immediately after World War II, Carl was hoping to graduate from college and teach history&#x2014;perhaps even at the university level&#x2014;if he could hang on to the GI Bill and his day job long enough to get his PhD. But in 1950, when he&#x2019;d been married just a few months, the surprise came that forced him to drop out of college: his wife was pregnant with their first child.<br><br> This was an era when husbands worked, wives tended the home, and being a good father and provider was one of the highest callings to which a man could aspire. Carl dropped out of school, kept his 9-to-5 job at a camera shop, and got a second job at a metal fabricating plant, working with molten metal from 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. For much of his wife&#x2019;s pregnancy and his newborn son&#x2019;s first year, he slept three hours a night and caught up on the weekends, but in the process he earned enough to get them an apartment and prepare for the costs of raising a family. Over the next forty-five years, he continued to work in the steel and machine industry, in the later years as a bookkeeper/manager for a Michigan tool-and-die company as three more sons were born.<br><br> Carl knew he was doing the right thing when he took that job in the factory, and he did it enthusiastically. Because the auto industry was unionized, he found he was able to support his entire family&#x2014;all four sons&#x2014;on one paycheck. He had fully funded health insurance, an annual vacation, and a good pension waiting for him when he retired. Carl had become a member of the middle class. He may not have achieved his personal dream of teaching history, but he had achieved the American dream. He was self-sufficient and free.<br><br> Working with molten metal could be dangerous, but the dangers were apparent, and Carl took every precaution to protect himself so that he could return home safe to his family. What he didn&#x2019;t realize, however, was that the asbestos used at the casting operation was an insidious poison. He didn&#x2019;t realize that the asbestos industry had known for decades that the stuff could kill but would continue to profitably market it for another twenty years while actively using its financial muscle to keep the general public in the dark and prevent the government from interfering.<br><br> A couple of years ago, Carl tripped on the stairs and ended up in the hospital with a compression fracture of his spine. He figured that fall also caused the terrible pain he&#x2019;d been experiencing in his abdomen. The doctors, however, discovered that his lungs were filled with mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer that is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma is terminal, and its victims die by slow and painful suffocation.<br><br> Just because some corporation put profit before people, Carl got screwed.<br><br> I was Carl&#x2019;s first child.<br><br> AN UNDECLARED WAR<br><br> My dad faced a painful death, but at least his job in a union shop left him with health care after retirement. Most Americans don&#x2019;t even have that reassurance anymore. More than 45 million Americans don&#x2019;t have health insurance to cover expenses for a serious illness; 5 million have lost their health insurance in the past four years alone. And it&#x2019;s not just illness that worries most Americans today. Americans are working more and making less. It&#x2019;s getting harder and harder to just get by.<br><br> There&#x2019;s a reason for the pain Americans are suffering.<br><br> The America my dad grew up in put people before profits. The America he lives in now puts profits before people.<br><br> In my dad&#x2019;s America, 35 percent of working people were union members who got a living wage, health insurance, and defined-benefits pensions. These union benefits lifted all boats because they set the floor for employment; for every union job, there was typically a nonunion job with similar pay and benefits (meaning roughly 70 percent of the American workforce back then could raise a family on a single paycheck). People who were disabled and couldn&#x2019;t work could live on Social Security payments, and the elderly knew they would have a safe retirement, paid for by pensions, Social Security, and Medicare. The gap between the richest and the poorest shrunk rather than widened.<br><br> That America is disappearing fast. The minimum wage&#x2014;just $5.15 per hour&#x2014;is not a living wage. Workers are now expected to pay for their own health insurance and their own retirement. Pension plans are disappearing&#x2014;30,000 General Motors employees lost theirs in 2005&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s continued talk of privatizing Social Security. The safety net is ripping apart, and the results are that the middle class is shrinking. The rich are once again getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer:<br><br> Image The inflation-adjusted average annual pay of a CEO went up from $7,773,000 to $9,600,000 from 2002 to 2004. Meanwhile, from 2000 to 2004, the inflation-adjusted median annual household income went down from $46,058 to $44,389. In other words, ordinary people&#x2019;s income went down by $1,669 while CEO pay went up by $1,827,000.1<br><br> Image Over the past four years, from 2001 to 2005, America has lost 2,818,000 manufacturing jobs. If you don&#x2019;t count jobs produced by the military-industrial complex, the number of private sector jobs created since 2001 has decreased by 1,160,000.2<br><br> Image Although 67 percent of large employers (more than 500 employees) offer a traditional pension, that is down from 91 percent two decades ago, and it&#x2019;s dropping fast as more companies freeze pensions and turn instead to 401(k)s.3 Only 6 percent of Americans working in the private sector can rely on a defined pension,4 and 76 percent of Baby Boomers say they don&#x2019;t think they are very prepared to meet their retirement expenses.5<br><br> Image Today only 60 percent of employers provide health care to their employees. More than 45 million Americans were without health insurance as of 2004, and we can only guess that that number has grown.6<br><br> You don&#x2019;t need the numbers because you probably already know someone who has been forced out of the middle class. Roger, for instance, who once was a vice president of research and development for a software engineering company, lost his job during the dot-com bust and never got it back. After being unemployed for seven years, he&#x2019;s thinking of getting a job as a &#x201c;landscape engineer"&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a gardener&#x2014;at a tenth of his former salary.<br><br> Or there&#x2019;s the case of Bob, a college graduate who has been holding three jobs for the past five years, one full-time as a bookstore clerk, two part-time. Even though he works sixty hours a week, he doesn&#x2019;t make enough money to rent his own apartment (he rents a room in a shared flat) and he can&#x2019;t afford health insurance. He hopes his allergies don&#x2019;t turn into asthma because he can&#x2019;t afford the medication he would need for that.<br><br> Too many Americans are just holding on. Consider Amy: Divorced from her alcoholic husband, she has gone back to school full-time to become a teacher; she earns a living by catering on the weekends. A single mother, she and her daughter share a studio apartment. Amy has neither health insurance nor child care and no nearby relatives&#x2014;she relies on neighbors to take care of her daughter. One major illness and Amy would be homeless.<br><br> And then there are most of the rest of us, who have good jobs but still don&#x2019;t feel secure about the future. Ralph and Sally both get health insurance through their jobs, but their mortgage eats up more than 60 percent of their income, and the clothes and the necessities they buy for their two kids consume whatever might be left after groceries and utilities. They have health insurance but no pension. Their retirement is based on the few thousand dollars a year they can put into their IRAs. They wonder how they will be able to send their kids to college and afford to retire.<br><br> Today a man like my dad couldn&#x2019;t support a family of six on one paycheck. The middle class my dad belonged to is on its deathbed. Meanwhile, sitting around the pool, waiting for the dividend checks to roll in (while paying a maximum 15 percent income tax), the corporate class grows even wealthier.<br><br> How can this be?<br><br> How is it that companies could sell asbestos when they knew it would kill people? Why do people go hungry in America, the world&#x2019;s wealthiest nation? Why is it that people like you and me who work long, full days cannot afford to get sick, cannot buy houses, and cannot send their kids to college? What&#x2019;s happened to the middle class?<br><br> These questions are about our economy, but the answer is about who we are as a country.<br><br> DEMOCRACY AND THE MIDDLE CLASS<br><br> The most ancient form of democracy is found among virtually all indigenous peoples of the world. It&#x2019;s the way humans have lived for more than 150,000 years. There are no rich and no poor among most tribal people&#x2014;everybody is &#x201c;middle class.&#x201d; There is also little hierarchy. The concept of &#x201c;chief&#x201d; is one that Europeans brought with them to America&#x2014;which in large part is what produced so much confusion in the 1600s and 1700s in America as most Native American tribes would never delegate absolute authority to any one person to sign a treaty. Instead decisions were made by consensus in these most ancient cauldrons of democracy.<br><br> The Founders of this nation, and the Framers of our Constitution, were heavily influenced and inspired by the democracy they saw all around them. Much of the U.S. Constitution is based on the Iroquois Confederacy&#x2014;the five (later six) tribes who occupied territories from New England to the edge of the Midwest. It was a democracy with elected representatives, an upper and lower house, and a supreme court (made up entirely of women, who held final say in five of the six tribes).<br><br> As Benjamin Franklin noted to his contemporaries at the Constitutional Convention: &#x201c;It would be a very strange thing if Six Nations of Ignorant Savages should be capable of forming a Scheme for such an Union and be able to execute it in such a manner, as that it has subsisted Ages, and appears indissoluble, and yet a like union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen English colonies.&#x201d;<br><br> The Framers modeled the oldest democracies, and the oldest forms of the middle class, and thus helped create the truly widespread and strong first middle class in the history of modern civilization.<br><br> Back in Europe, however, the sort of democracy the Framers were borrowing and inventing, and even the existence of a middle class itself, was considered unnatural. For most of the seven thousand years of recorded human history, all the way back to the Gilgamesh Epic, the oldest written story, what we call a middle class is virtually unheard of&#x2014;as was democracy. Throughout most of the history of what we call civilization, an unrestrained economy and the idea of hierarchical social organization has always produced a small ruling elite and a large number of nearly impoverished workers.<br><br> Up until the founding of America, the middle class was considered unnatural by many political philosophers. Thomas Hobbes wrote in his 1651 magnum opus Leviathan that the world was better off with the rule of the few over the many, even if that meant that the many were impoverished. Without a strong and iron-fisted ruler, Hobbes wrote, there would be &#x201c;no place for industry . . . no arts, no letters, no society.&#x201d; Because Hobbes believed that ordinary people couldn&#x2019;t govern themselves, he believed that most people would be happy to exchange personal freedom and economic opportunity for the ability to live in safety and security. For the working class to have both freedom and security, Hobbes suggested, was impossible.<br><br> Our nation&#x2019;s Founders disagreed. They believed in the rights of ordinary people to self-determination, so they created a form of government where We the People rule. They declared that all people, and not just the elite, have the right to &#x201c;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; (In that declaration, Thomas Jefferson replaced John Locke&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;life, liberty, and property&#x201d; with &#x201c;life, liberty, and happiness"&#x2014;the first time the word had ever appeared in the founding document of any nation.) They believed that We the People could create a country founded on personal freedom and economic opportunity for all. The Founders believed in the power of a middle class; and in defiance of Hobbes and the conventional wisdom of Europe, they believed that democracy and a middle class were the &#x201c;natural state of man.&#x201d;<br><br> As John Quincy Adams argued before the Supreme Court in 1841 on behalf of freeing rebelling slaves in the Amistad case, he stood before and pointed to a copy of the Declaration of Independence:<br><br> That DECLARATION says that every man is &#x201c;endowed by his Creator with certain inalienable rights,&#x201d; and that &#x201c;among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; . . . I will not here discuss the right or the rights of slavery, but I say that the doctrine of Hobbes, that War is the natural state of man, has for ages been exploded, as equally disclaimed and rejected by the philosopher and the Christian. That it is utterly incompatible with any theory of human rights, and especially with the rights which the Declaration of Independence proclaims as self-evident truths.<br><br> It turns out that the Founders knew something Hobbes didn&#x2019;t know: political democracy and an economic middle class is the natural state of humankind. Indeed, it&#x2019;s the natural state of the entire animal kingdom.<br><br> For example, biologists used to think that animal societies were ruled by alpha males. Recent studies, however, have found that while it&#x2019;s true that alpha males (and females, in some species) have the advantage in courtship rituals, that&#x2019;s where their power ends. Biologists Tim Roper and L. Conradt discovered that animals don&#x2019;t follow a leader but instead move together.7<br><br> James Randerson did a follow-up study with red deer to prove the point.8 How does a herd of deer decide it&#x2019;s time to stop grazing and go toward the watering hole? As they&#x2019;re grazing, various deer point their bodies in seemingly random directions, until it comes time to go drink. Then individuals begin to graze while facing one of several watering holes. When a majority of deer are pointing toward one particular watering hole, they all move in that direction. Randerson saw instances where the alpha deer was actually one of the last to move toward the hole rather than one of the first.<br><br> When I interviewed Tim Roper about his research at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, he told me that when his findings were first published, scientists from all over the world called to tell him that they were seeing the same thing with their research subjects. Birds flying in flocks aren&#x2019;t following a leader but monitoring the motions of those around them for variations in the flight path; when more than 50 percent have moved in a particular direction&#x2014;even if it&#x2019;s only a quarter-inch in one direction or another&#x2014;the entire flock &#x201c;suddenly&#x201d; veers off that way. It&#x2019;s the same with fish and even with swarms of gnats. Roper said that his colleagues were telling him that from ants to gorillas, democracy is the norm among animals. Just like with indigenous human societies&#x2014;which have had hundreds of thousands of years of trial and error to work out the best ways to live&#x2014;democracy is the norm among animals, and (other than for the Darwinian purpose of finding the best mate) hierarchy/kingdom is the rarity.<br><br> Thus, we discover, this close relationship between the middle class and democracy is burned into our DNA&#x2014;along with that of the entire animal kingdom (an ironic term, given this new informa...</p><h2>Everything Necessary: God&#39;s Provisions for the Holy Life (Student)</h2><p>Holiness is the kind of life that God commands and Christians aspire to.

When she was a child, her baby brother was shot to death by a man named Preacher Eli. Orphaned by her teens, Sylvie is now raising her own baby with no partner in sight. For all these reasons, Leah Teal, Alvin, Alabama's only detective, tries to stay patient when Sylvie calls the station day and night, always with some new false alarm. But now Preacher Eli is out of prison and moving back to town. <br><br>As far as the law is concerned, the old man has paid his dues--though Leah's twelve-year-old son, Abe, vehemently disagrees. Between that and his relentless curiosity about the daddy he hardly knew, Abe's imagination is running in all directions lately. While Leah struggles with how much of the past to reveal to Abe, she's also concerned about Sylvie's mounting panic. Something in her gut tells her the girl might be a target after all. For as Leah knows well, there's danger not just in the secrets others keep from us, but in the lies that corrupt from within. It's a hunch that will be tested soon enough, as tensions mount on both sides. <br><br>Evoking the South with depth and grace, Michael Hiebert's poignant, gripping novel captures the strength wrought by heartache and lost innocence--and the transformative power of forgiveness, whenever it comes. . .<br><br><b>Praise for Michael Hiebert's Dream with Little Angels</b><br><br>"Hiebert's first novel courts comparison to the classic <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but the book manages to soar as a moving achievement in its own right.

He was a dark, cynical and pessimistic soul who had a grim vision of fate and the unfairness of life, which he channelled into his fiction. And in his death, or rather his disappearance, he created a mystery as strange and unresolved as any that he penned himself. But more of that later. Ambrose Gwinett Bierce was born in a log cabin on 21st June 1842, in Horse Creek, Meigs County, Ohio, USA. He was the tenth of thirteen children, ten of whom survived infancy. His father, an unsuccessful farmer with an unseemly love of literature, had given all the Bierce children names beginning with &#39;A&#39;. There was Abigail, the eldest; then Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius etc. So oddness was a part of Bierce&#39;s life from the beginning. Poverty and religion of the extreme variety were the two chief influences on young Ambrose&#39;s childhood. He not only hated this period of his life, he also developed a deep hatred for his family and this is reflected in some of his stories which depict families preying on and murdering one another. For example the unforgettable opening sentence of An Imperfect Conflagration seems to sum up his bitter attitude: &#39;Early in 1872 I murdered my father - an act that made a deep impression on me at the time&#39;.</p><p></p><h2>The Return</h2><p>One of the remarkable qualities of Bolano&#39;s short stories is that they seem to tell what Bolano called &#39;the secret story&#39;, &#39;the one we&#39;ll never know&#39;. The Return contains thirteen unforgettable tales bent on returning to haunt you, most of them appearing in English for the first time here. Wide-ranging, suggestive, and daring, a Bolano story is just as likely to concern the unexpected fate of a beautiful ex-girlfriend, the history of a porn star or two embittered police detectives debating their favourite weapons: his plots go anywhere and everywhere and they always surprise. Consider the title piece: a young party animal collapses in a Parisian disco and dies on the dance floor; just as his soul is departing his body, it realizes strange doings are afoot -- and what follows next defies the imagination (except Bolano&#39;s own, of course).

Delectable treats will be at the fingertips of each reader as they follow the easy-to-create recipes for the holidays. Helpful photographs and accessible instructions help beginning chefs whip up Thanksgiving eats that everyone will love.</p><p>Gr 3-6-"Easter Brunch Eggs," "Eyeball Cupcakes," and "Apple-Honey Cranberry Sauce" are a sampling of the fun recipes found in these holiday-themed cookbooks. Each one utilizes easily accessible tools and features helpful information for young cooks before they get started, such as measurements, safety, and basic techniques. The authors regularly remind kids to seek out adult supervision, which is important since nearly all the recipes require the stove and/or oven. The stock photos in each book can sometimes feel low-quality, but what recommends them is that they often feature finished products that look like they were decorated by a kid rather than an aspiring Martha Stewart. Each title also features nutritional tidbits and interesting "food facts." The books have a mix of both savory dishes and desserts (the titles are somewhat misleading). Easter specifically references the "Christian calendar" and the "Christian Bible"; it also describes the holiday as a secular celebration and a "rebirth in nature." A quibble: having the list of ingredients for each recipe on a separate page from the instructions is less than ideal.-Laura Lutz, Pratt Institute, New York City&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

He lived alongside badgers for weeks, eating earthworms and learning to sense the landscape by smell rather than sight. He tried to catch fish in his teeth while swimming like an otter, rooted through London garbage cans as an urban fox, was hunted by bloodhounds as a red deer, nearly dying in the snow.

A physician, Tess Gerritsen lives in Maine.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Chapter One<br><br> They looked like the perfect family.<br><br> This was what the boy thought as he stood beside his father&#x2019;s open grave, as he listened to the hired minister read platitudes from the Bible. Only a small group had gathered on that warm and buggy June day to mourn the passing of Montague Saul, no more than a dozen people, many of whom the boy had just met. For the past six months, he had been away at boarding school, and today he was seeing some of these people for the very first time. Most of them did not interest him in the least.<br><br> But his uncle&#x2019;s family&#x2014;they interested him very much. They were worth studying.<br><br> Dr. Peter Saul looked very much like his dead brother Montague, slender and cerebral in owlish glasses, brown hair thinning toward inevitable baldness. His wife, Amy, had a round, sweet face, and she kept darting anxious looks at her fifteen-year-old nephew, as though aching to wrap her arms around him and smother him with a hug. Their son, Teddy, was ten years old, all skinny arms and legs. A little clone of Peter Saul, right down to the same owlish glasses.<br><br> Finally, there was the daughter, Lily. Sixteen years old.<br><br> Tendrils of her hair had come loose from the ponytail and now clung to her face in the heat. She looked uncomfortable in her black dress, and she kept shifting coltishly back and forth, as though preparing to bolt. As though she&#x2019;d rather be anywhere than in this cemetery, waving away buzzing insects.<br><br> They look so normal, so average, the boy thought. So different from me. Then Lily&#x2019;s gaze suddenly met his, and he felt a tremor of surprise. Of mutual recognition. In that instant, he could almost feel her gaze penetrating the darkest fissures of his brain, examining all the secret places that no one else had ever seen. That he&#x2019;d never allowed them to see.<br><br> Disquieted, he looked away. Focused, instead, on the other people standing around the grave: His father&#x2019;s housekeeper. The attorney. The two next-door neighbors. Mere acquaintances who were here out of a sense of propriety, not affection. They knew Montague Saul only as the quiet scholar who&#x2019;d recently returned from Cyprus, who spent his days fussing over books and maps and little pieces of pottery. They did not really know the man. Just as they did not really know his son.<br><br> At last the service ended, and the gathering moved toward the boy, like an amoeba preparing to engulf him in sympathy, to tell him how sorry they were that he&#x2019;d lost his father. And so soon after moving to the United States.<br><br> &#x201c;At least you have family here to help you,&#x201d; said the minister.<br><br> Family? Yes, I suppose these people are my family, the boy thought, as little Teddy shyly approached, urged forward by his mother.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be my brother now,&#x201d; said Teddy.<br><br> &#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mom has your room all ready for you. It&#x2019;s right next to mine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m staying here. In my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;<br><br> Bewildered, Teddy looked at his mother. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he coming home with us?&#x201d;<br><br> Amy Saul quickly said, &#x201c;You really can&#x2019;t live all by yourself, dear. You&#x2019;re only fifteen. Maybe you&#x2019;ll like it so much in Purity, you&#x2019;ll want to stay with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My school&#x2019;s in Connecticut.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but the school year&#x2019;s over now. In September, if you want to return to your boarding school, of course you can. But for the summer, you&#x2019;ll come home with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be alone here. My mother will come for me.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a long silence. Amy and Peter looked at each other, and the boy could guess what they were thinking. His mother abandoned him ages ago.<br><br> &#x201c;She is coming for me,&#x201d; he insisted.<br><br> Uncle Peter said, gently, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it later, son.&#x201d;<br><br> In the night, the boy laid awake in his bed, in his father&#x2019;s town house, listening to the voices of his aunt and uncle murmuring downstairs in the study. The same study where Montague Saul had labored these past months to translate his fragile little scraps of papyrus. The same study where, five days ago, he&#x2019;d had a stroke and collapsed at his desk. Those people should not be in there, among his father&#x2019;s precious things. They were invaders in his house.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s still just a boy, Peter. He needs a family.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t exactly drag him back to Purity if he doesn&#x2019;t want to come with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re only fifteen, you have no choice in the matter. Adults have to make the decisions.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy rose from bed and slipped out of his room. He crept halfway down the stairs to listen in to the conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;And really, how many adults has he known? Your brother didn&#x2019;t exactly qualify. He was so wrapped up in his old mummy linens, he probably never noticed there was a child underfoot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair, Amy. My brother was a good man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good, but clueless. I can&#x2019;t imagine what kind of woman would dream of having a child with him. And then she leaves the boy behind for Monty to raise? I don&#x2019;t understand any woman who&#x2019;d do that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty didn&#x2019;t do such a bad job raising him. The boy&#x2019;s getting top marks in school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your measurement for what makes a good father? The fact that the boy gets top marks?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s also a poised young man. Look how well he held up at the service.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s numb, Peter. Did you see a single emotion on his face today?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monty was like that, too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cold-blooded, you mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, intellectual. Logical.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But underneath it all, you know that boy has got to be hurting. It makes me want to cry, how much he needs his mother right now. How he keeps insisting she&#x2019;ll come back for him, when we know she won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve never even met the woman! Monty just writes us from Cairo one day, to tell us he has a brand-new son. For all we know, he plucked him up from the reeds, like baby Moses.&#x201d;<br><br> The boy heard the floor creak above him, and he glanced toward the top of the stairs. He was startled to see his cousin Lily staring down at him over the banister. She was watching him, studying him, as if he were some exotic creature she&#x2019;d never before encountered and she was trying to decide if he was dangerous.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said Aunt Amy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re up!&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt and uncle had just come out of the study, and they were standing at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at him. Looking a little dismayed, too, at the possibility that he had overheard their entire conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you feeling all right, dear?&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Auntie.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so late. Maybe you should go back to bed now?&#x201d;<br><br> But he didn&#x2019;t move. He paused on the stairs for a moment, wondering what it would be like to live with these people. What he might learn from them. It would make the summer interesting, until his mother came for him.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Aunt Amy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About my summer, and where I&#x2019;d like to spend it.&#x201d;<br><br> She instantly assumed the worst. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be too hasty! We have a really nice house, right on the lake, and you&#x2019;d have your own room. At least come for a visit before you decide.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve decided to come stay with you.&#x201d;<br><br> His aunt paused, temporarily stunned. Then her face lit up in a smile, and she hurried up the steps to give him a hug. She smelled like Dove soap and Breck shampoo. So average, so ordinary. Then a grinning Uncle Peter gave him an affectionate clap on the shoulder, his way of welcoming a new son. Their happiness was like a web of spun sugar, drawing him into their universe, where all was love and light and laughter.<br><br> &#x201c;The kids will be so glad you&#x2019;re coming back with us!&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> He glanced toward the top of the stairs, but Lily was no longer there. She had slipped away, unnoticed. I will have to keep my eye on her, he thought. Because already, she&#x2019;s keeping her eye on me.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re part of our family now,&#x201d; said Amy.<br><br> As they walked up the stairs together, she was already telling him her plans for the summer. All the places they&#x2019;d take him, all the special meals they&#x2019;d cook for him when they got back home. She sounded happy, even giddy, like a mother with her brand-new baby.<br><br> Amy Saul had no idea what they were about to bring home with them.</p><h2>Jesse Oonark: A Retrospective</h2><p>1st ed.

While in New York City working as a magazine illustrator he began writing his first novel, The Ipcress File, which was published in 1962. He is now the author of more than thirty books of fiction and non-fiction. At present living in Europe, he has, over the years, lived with his family in ten different countries from Austria to Portugal.</p>In the first of Len Deighton&#39;s espionage sextet, he introduces his enduring spy hero, Bernard Samson. Not only is Deighton setting up characters who go through the entire series, but Daneman must also set a vocal style for each of Samson&#39;s Berlin friends and English co-patriots. Daneman succeeds masterfully. His lively characterizations of the elegant Silas Gaunt, irritating Dicky Cruyer and mercurial Werner Volkmann are a delight. The dialogue is lively with each character&#39;s voice wholly distinct. As often happens at the end, one wants more time with these characters--and there is. R.F.W.

Written in a popular style, Heaven and the Afterlife touches on many topics related to life after death, including amazing near-death experiences, accounts from the Bible, testimonies, theories, and what some of the world&#39;s religions believe. It will demystify the afterlife with information about heaven, hell, ghosts, angels, near-death experiences, and much more, helping readers gain a solid understanding of the often-confusing subject of life after death.

However, today&#x2019;s managing directors must balance often conflicting roles, more demanding clients, tougher competitors, and associates with higher expectations of partners at all levels.<br><br>When Professionals Have to Lead presents an overarching framework better suited to such complexity. It identifies the four critical activities for effective PSF leadership: setting strategic direction, securing commitment to this direction, facilitating execution, and setting a personal example. Through examples from consulting practices, accounting firms, investment banks, and other professional service organizations, industry veterans DeLong, Gabarro, and Lees show how this model works to:<br> Align your firm&#x2019;s culture and key organizational components.<br> Satisfy your clients&#x2019; needs without sacrificing essential managerial responsibilities.<br> Address matters of size, scale, and complexity while maintaining the qualities that make professional services firms unique.<br><br>A valuable new resource, this book redefines the role of leadership in professional services firms.</p><p>Thomas J.

In this charming, expertly crafted new mystery set in the twilight of Iowa&#39;s 1950s, fledgling lawyer Sam McCain is dancing to a different tune when he discovers that the beautiful blonde who&#39;s been tracking him in her black Ford convertible is interested in more than his red ragtop. She&#39;s Lila Leigh Mulchaey, and McCain&#39;s in love. Two problems, though, darken McCain&#39;s mood: Lila is pregnant, and Philip Mulchaey, her father - an outspoken advocate of left-wing causes who&#39;d been fired from his job in the State Department during the McCarthy trials - stands at the center of the political storm surrounding the upcoming visit of Nikita Kruschev to Iowa. Then Philip Mulchaey turns up dead. That he was murdered for his politics, everybody, including McCain&#39;s sometime employer, the imperious Judge Esme Anne Whitney, assumes. McCain, however, is not so sure. Murder&#39;s usually more personal in Black River Falls.</p><p>Ed Gorman, winner of the Shamus, the SPUR, and the International Fiction Writer&#39;s Award among others, is the author of numerous highly praised novels. He lives in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Robert Hale also published his previous novel, The Day the Music Died.Joe McCarthy's better-dead-than-red mentality has penetrated even the small Iowa burg of Black River Falls, where young Sam McCain supplements his earnings as a lawyer by working as a private investigator. At the conclusion of a photo-op appearance by touring Soviet premier Nikita Khruschev, former State Department official and Black River Falls resident, Richard Conners, a notorious liberal, indicates he'd like to hire McCain. He shows up at McCain's apartment a day later, near death, but he won't expose his attacker. McCain has no faith in the investigative ability of local law enforcement, so he proceeds on his own. In short order, he's also confronted with the deaths of a former FBI agent now fronting an anti-Communist organization and two other right-wing activists. The third Sam McCain case is as compelling and entertaining as its predecessors. Gorman, an underappreciated master of the genre, has created an insular, self-contained world in Black River Falls, where good and evil clash with the same heartbreaking results as they have in the more urban crime dramas of Block or Leonard. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Fired by the revolutionary idealism of mid-nineteenth century Europe, he hopes to aid a cause which he believes to be as simple as he knows to be just. But thwarted by the discovery of a physical deformity which he had hoped to conceal, he must try other means to find his &#34;truth.&#34; Wilderness id the story of Adam&#39;s adventures in America, which from the moment he sets foot on shore demand a profound revision of his view of the world and of his place in it. In the fast-moving narrative, full of surprising events and extraordinary characters, we have the story of Adam&#39;s growth, by experience, to a deeper understanding of himself and of the world he must accept before he can take his proper place in it - and of that idealism by which, as he rediscovers in the end, he must live.</p><p>&#x201c;A moving and disturbing work&#x2014;one which goes beyond events, to brood upon their meanings.&#x201d;&#x2014;Samuel Hynes, New York Times Book Review<br><br>In the summer of 1863, Adam Rosenzweig leaves a Bavarian ghetto and sails for the United States to fight for the North in the Civil War. Fired by a revolutionary idealism inherited from his father, he hopes to aid a cause that he believes to be as simple as he knows it to be just.<br><br>Over the course of his journey, Adam becomes witness to a world whose complexity does not readily conform to his ideals of liberty. When his twisted foot attracts unwanted attention on his voyage to America, he is threatened with return to Europe. He jumps ship in New York, only to be caught up in the violence and horror of the anti-draft riots. Eventually he reaches the Union Army, serving not as a soldier but as a civilian provisioner&#x2019;s assistant. Adam&#x2019;s encounters with others&#x2014;among them a wealthy benefactor, a former slave, an exiled Southerner, a bushwacker and his wife&#x2014;further challenge the absolutism that informs his view of the world and of his place in it.<br><br>First published in 1961, Wilderness remains a profoundly provocative meditation on the significance of the Civil War and the varieties of human experience.

At the heart of the discussion stands the theoretical work of Piero Sraffa and the conclusions drawn from it by such economists as Ian Steedman. Initially confined to a relatively narrow circle of specialists, the controversy about value theory has since spread to wider circles of the left. But although general awareness that the stakes of the dispute are of concern to all socialists is now extensive, understanding of the issues involved has remained more restricted than need be. This volume presents, for the first time, a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the discussion. The essays discuss not only the value debate itself, but also its relevance to such issues as capitalist crisis, the theory of exploitation, and historical materialism. Comprehensible to the non-specialist, but without sacrificing rigour or oversimplifying the issues, the articles assembled here offer a definitive summary of the current state of one of the crucial aspects of Marxist thought.</p><p><b>Erik Olin Wright</b> is Vilas Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin.

Judging from this collection, those days are long gone. Not every work is flawless?there are awkward dialogues and oblique narratives that are more maladroit than experimental. Whatever their faults, however, most of the 22 contributors here are willing to imagine being someone else, somewhere else. Some of the best stories are surrealistically inventive: Natasha Waxman's account of a college dropout's transmogrification into a primitive state; Tenaya Rahel Darlington's eerie tale of Poe-like obsession; Christopher A. Pasetto's slyly funny story of a teenage conspiracy theorist's first love. And even the less magical contributions dare to go beyond the merely confessional, as authors tackle characters of the opposite sex and wildly varying ages. At its strongest and weakest, the second installment in this series is heartening evidence of courage in the classroom and on the page. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Phantom: The Last Vampire 4</h2><p>The dead alchemist&#39;s experiment is a success--Alisa is alive again after five thousand years, pregnant with a baby that grows at a supernatural speed--but only a stranger can tell her if the child will be an angel or a demon</p><p><b>Christopher Pike</b> was born in Brooklyn, New York, but grew up in Los Angeles, where he lives to this day.

Now, in a long-awaited follow-up, Mogel addresses the question she hears most frequently: what to do when those children become teenagers, when their sense of independence and entitlement grows, the pressure to compete and succeed skyrockets, and communication becomes fraught with obstacles? <br><br>With her warmth, wit, and signature combination of Jewish teachings and psychological research, Mogel helps parents to ably navigate the often rough journey through the teenage years and guide children to becoming confident, resilient young adults. By viewing the frustrating and worrisome elements of adolescence as 'blessings,' Mogel reveals that they are in fact necessary steps in psychological growth and character development to be met with faith, detachment, and a sense of humor rather than over-involvement and anxiety. Mogel gives parents the tools to do so and offers reassuring spiritual and ethical advice on <br><br>� why influence is more effective than control. <br><br>� teenage narcissism. <br><br>� living graciously with rudeness. <br><br>� the value of ordinary work. <br><br>� why risk is essential preparation for the post&#x2013;high school years. <br><br>� when to step in and when to step back. <br><br>� a sanctified approach to sex and substances. <br><br>An important and inspiring book that will fortify parents through the teenage years, The Blessing of a B Minus is itself a blessing.</p><p>Wendy Mogel, PhD, is a practicing clinical psychologist, international public speaker, and&nbsp;the author of <i>Voice Lessons for Parents</i>, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times </i>bestseller<i>&nbsp;The Blessing of a Skinned Knee</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Blessing of a B Minus</i>.

It has been adapted for the screen several times, of which the 1970 film version is the best known. When Father is taken away unexpectedly, Roberta, Peter, Phyllis and their mother have to leave their comfortable life in London to go and live in a small cottage in the country. The children seek solace in the nearby railway station, and make friends with Perks the Porter and the Station Master himself. Each day, Roberta, Peter and Phyllis run down the field to the railway track and wave at the passing London train, sending their love to Father.</p><p>They were not railway children to begin with... They did not guess then how they would grow to love the railway, and how soon it would become the centre of their new life, nor what wonders and changes it would bring them.English author Edith Nesbit s impressive body of work includes poems, plays, novels, and even ghost stories, however, she is best known for her beloved children s adventure stories, published under the name E. Nesbit. Among Nesbit s best-known works are The Story of the Treasure-Seekers, The Railway Children, The Wouldbegoods and Five Children and It. Nesbit s novels departed from the children s literary tradition of fantasy-worlds popularized by Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, and instead focused on the adventures to be had from real-life experiences. Nesbit s work inspired other writers like C. S. Lewis, P. L Travers, and J. K. Rowling, and many of her stories have been adapted for film and television. In addition to writing, Nesbit was an activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a socialist group that provided the foundation for the modern British Labour Party.

This influence is, in my opinion, largely exerted irresponsibly, arbitrarily, and without reference to any moral or intellectual, still less spiritual guidelines whatsoever.&#34; Throughout his journalistic career, Malcolm Muggeridge was a commentator. On radio and television, as a lecturer, journalist and author, he fascinated, delighted, provoked-and sometimes infuriated-his audiences. Christ and the Media is a sharp, witty critique of media-oriented culture with such intriguing fantasies as the &#34;the Fourth Temptation,&#34; in which Jesus is approached with the offer of a worldwide TV network. &#34;Future historians,&#34; wrote Muggeridge, &#34;will surely see us as having created in the media a Frankenstein monster which no one knows how to control or direct, and marvel that we should have so meekly subjected ourselves to its destructive and often malign influence. Born in 1903 started his career as a university lecturer at the university in Cairo before taking up journalism. As a journalist he worked around the world on the Guardian, Calcutta Statesman, the Evening Standard and the Daily Telegraph, and then in 1953 became editor of Punch where he remained for four years. In later years he became best known as a broadcaster both on television and radio for the BBC. His other books include Jesus Rediscovered, Jesus: The Man Who Lives, and A Third Testament.

Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.<br><br>Far from being a na�ve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature--tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking--which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. <br><br>With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.</p><p></p><h2>The Girl I Used to Be</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the Anthony Award for Best Young Adult Mystery Novel</b><br><b></b><br>When Olivia's mother was killed, everyone suspected her father of murder.

The student claims he is innocent, but all the evidence indicates otherwise. Joseph Antonelli leaves his Oregon law practice to put up a case for the defence. He soon discovers a world of deceit, betrayal and naked ambition.</p><p>Whoever shot and killed U.S. Senator Jeremy Fullerton may have wanted more than his wallet--the ambitious politician had as many enemies as supporters. Portland criminal lawyer Joseph Antonelli is hired to defend the young black Berkeley student who was caught fleeing the crime scene, since no local lawyer wants to risk his reputation on a case that might uncover secrets some very powerful members of the San Francisco establishment would prefer to keep buried. Joe doesn't believe Fullerton died in what the bench, bar, and press have characterized as a "random act of violence"--furthermore, he's convinced that his client, Jamal Washington, is innocent. But in order to prove it, he must uncover those same secrets others have killed to protect, and if he's not careful, he may end up as their next victim. The key to Washington's defense is a <i>Manchurian Candidate</i>-like conspiracy set in motion long ago, one that ultimately unfolds in an Italian village in a surprising denouement only the most discerning reader will have guessed at. D.W. Buffa excels at describing the courtroom tactics of his smart, thoughtful protagonist--he's more of a pro than most other writers of legal thrillers--and he's a deft hand with pacing, too. Fans of Grisham and Turow who haven't yet made Buffa's acquaintance are in for a very satisfying read. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Attorney Joseph Antonelli leaves Oregon to take a case no San Francisco lawyer will touch. U.S. Senator Jeremy Fullerton is murdered on a pea-soup foggy night. Jamaal is accused but pleads innocent; and while Antonelli digs to find the truth, life becomes dangerous for all involved. Mark Feuerstein reads the narration with a clear, strong voice, pausing definitively at each period. His characterizations are colorful, and his accents provide wonderful verbal images of the speakers. As the action speeds up, Feuerstein maintains his steady and unemotional narration.

When Tommy falters at homesteading, the siblings look to the coal mines and Addie comes into close contact with one Chinese man in particular, Wing Lee. The bond between the two is a mere spark at first, hampered by the reality for both that a friendship would be impossible, forbidden, even in a territory where almost everyone is an immigrant. </p><p>Together, Addie and Wing harbor a secret.

W. Higginson in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1870. "The American poet of passion is yet to come." He was, of course, unaware of the great erotic love poems such as "Wild Nights--Wild Nights!" and "Struck was I, nor yet by Lightning" being privately written by his reclusive friend Emily Dickinson. </p><p> In a profound new analysis of Dickinson's life and work, Judith Farr explores the desire, suffering, exultation, spiritual rapture, and intense dedication to art that characterize Dickinson's poems, and deciphers their many complex and witty references to texts and paintings of the day. In <i>The Passion of Emily Dickinson</i> the poet emerges, not as a cryptic proto-modern or a victim of female repression, but as a cultivated mid-Victorian in whom the romanticism of Emerson and the American landscape painters found bold expression. </p><p> Dickinson wrote two distinct cycles of love poetry, argues Farr, one for her sister-in-law Sue and one for the mysterious "Master," here convincingly identified as Samuel Bowles, a friend of the family. For each of these intimates, Dickinson crafted personalized metaphoric codes drawn from her reading. Calling books her "Kinsmen of the Shelf," she refracted elements of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Tennyson's <i>Maud</i>, De Quincey's <i>Confessions</i>, and key biblical passages into her writing. And, to a previously unexplored degree, Dickinson also quoted the strategies and subject matter of popular Hudson River, Luminist, and Pre-Raphaelite paintings, notably Thomas Cole's <i>Voyage of Life</i> and Frederic Edwin Church's <i>Heart of the Andes</i>. Involved in the delicate process of both expressing and disguising her passion, Dickinson incorporated these sources in an original and sophisticated manner. </p><p> Farr's superb readings of the poems and letters call on neglected archival material and on magazines, books, and paintings owned by the Dickinsons. Viewed as part of a finely articulated tradition of Victorian iconography, Dickinson's interest in the fate of the soul after death, her seclusion, her fascination with landscape's mystical content, her quest for honor and immortality through art, and most of all her very human passions become less enigmatic. Farr tells the story of a poet and her time.</p></p><p>In a profound new analysis of Dickinson&#39;s life and work, Judith Farr explores the desire, suffering, exultation, spiritual rapture, and intense dedication to art that characterize Dickinson&#39;s poems, deciphering their many complex and witty references to texts and paintings of the day.<b>Judith Farr</b> is Professor of English Emerita, Georgetown University.</p><h2>Advertising Concept Book</h2><p><br>In creative advertising, no amount of glossy presentation will improve a bad idea.

Here he has produced an excellent general history of American higher education, beginning with a discussion of its current problems. Smith's insights and controversial comments have the potential for upsetting those wedded to the status quo in higher education in the same fashion that A Nation at Risk did for K-12 public education. Approximately one third of the book deals with the "sacred cows," foibles, and fallacies of higher education: tenure; graduate assistants teaching instead of faculty; the publish or perish syndrome; women's studies; the nonscientific social sciences; and the inhumanity of the humanities. One oversight of the book is the lack of mention of the community/junior college movement. For eductors, administrators, and others concerned with the future of higher education. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 11/15/89.<br><i>- Scott Johnson, Meridian Community Coll. Lib., Miss.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.To the continuing debate about the ills of American higher education, Smith, founding provost of UC Santa Cruz, contributes probing, provocative insights. With a tribute to his undergraduate mentor, Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, Harvard social philosophy professor and often disparaged radical thinker, the author sets about "mapping the desert" of contemporary higher education. After a lucid traverse of the development of education in the U.S., he sums up its present state as "Academic fundamentalism. . . the stubborn refusal of the academy to acknowledge any truth that does not conform to professorial dogmas." In Smith's view, a meld of the classical Christian traditions with secular democracy may restore the modern university as a true "academic community." 30,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Where Heaven and Mountains Meet: Zanskar and the Himalayas</h2><p>Deep in the heart of the Himalayas, isolated from the outside world by snow for nine months of the year, the ancient kingdom of Zanskar seems light years away from the modern world and its inhabitants. Olivier F�&#x153;llmi and his wife, Danielle, have made numerous trips to Zanskar over the past twenty years, the results of which are eloquently revealed in this volume. Breathtaking photographs and a moving text combine to record the rites and customs of an exceptional people, enriched by traditional wisdom, in a Buddhist land where religion and its observance define a way of life.</p><p>Danielle and Olivier Follmi are the founders of HOPE (Himalayan Organization for People and Education), which supports educational projects in the Himalayas. Olivier Follmi published an earlier collection of photographs of the region, entitled Zanskar (1989).Zanskar is a small dependency of about 10,000 people in a remote high-mountain valley area on the eastern side of the Indian state of Kashmir. Its peoples are mostly followers of Tibetan Buddhism. Isolated by high mountains, until recently it had little contact with the outside world. F?llmi is a French photographer who became attracted to the area in the 1980s and over the years has made several visits there to photograph and write about it. The book is primarily visual, with his striking photographs and some traditional border decorations by Rapkar Wangchuk; the limited text focuses on F?llmi's travels and sponsorship of two children for education abroad. While he introduces the conflicts the outside world is bringing to Zanskar, he doesn't probe deeply into them. Still, this is a beautiful book on a little-known area and a rapidly changing way of life.

IP.</p><p>One of the minences grises of children's literature recasts memoirs originally published in French and German for this lively, sardonic account of the multiple occupations of his native Alsace in WWII. Ungerer views those ``absurd and tragic time s'' from both adult and childish perspectives, recalling his mother's taste for practical jokes and unfailing ability to charm her way around the demands of officialdom, describing the radical changes imposed on every aspect of daily life by the Nazis and the quiet, clever Alsatian resistance, regarding all of the armies, including the ``gallinaceous'' French and aloof, insensitive American, as invadersif sometimes welcome ones. Due in part to his own family's habit of never throwing anything away, and in part to gifts from readers of the foreign-language editions, the author supplies a mind-boggling array of illustrations: photos, postcards, cartoons, advertisements, stamps, posters, old school assignments, childhood drawings, propaganda leaflets, souven irs, and more, many reproduced in full-color, nearly all at least partly translated in explanatory captions. Ungerer does not deny the prison camps, anti-Semitism, and general terror of the experience, but serves up more tributes here than indictmentsand by looking for the humor, or at least the irony, in every situation, he effectively demonstrates the triumph of spirit over circumstance.

He&#x2019;d talk to Jean-Claude tomorrow. �tienne sensed that the caretaker had never really liked him, or perhaps his coolness was out of respect for their difference in class; Jean-Claude was polite but never looked his employer in the eye. They had easily avoided each other while �tienne&#x2019;s parents were still alive, but as �tienne was now the only Bremont living in Aix, the ch�teau&#x2019;s enormous upkeep required that owner and caretaker have more frequent contact. Jean-Claude was a huge man but clumsy. His size had never caused �tienne much worry, but there was something in the way Jean-Claude looked at him sometimes that made him uneasy. �tienne de Bremont had recently found himself fascinated by the caretaker&#x2019;s enormous hands, which would lie stiffly at his sides as he received his employer&#x2019;s blunt instructions; after a few seconds his fat fingers would slowly, and then quickly, begin to twitch, as if they were waiting for messages from the brain that would call them into action. At any rate, the fingers seemed to be thinking ahead of the slow, still hands.</p><p>Luckily �tienne had brought a flashlight with him, out of habit. There was always a burnt-out lightbulb somewhere in the crumbling ch�teau&#x2014;a home that no one lived in, more trouble than it was worth. He shone the light around the dusty room, one of the only rooms of the twenty-odd that brought him some good memories. His first ten-speed bike was propped up in a corner: it had taken him downhill into Aix-en-Provence in forty-five minutes, the return trip took almost double that. He was fit then, and still was, considering in five years he would be forty.</p><p>Next to the bike, a rosary hung on the post of a nineteenth-century iron bed, as it always had, and he thought of her laughing face and green eyes. He missed her, but it wouldn&#x2019;t do to call. Their lives were too different, their friends too different. Especially their friends.</p><p>There was a full moon that night, and �tienne walked over to the window. It was covered by a wooden shutter a meter wide and two meters tall. He swung it open, careful to latch it against the stone wall with his left hand as he held on tightly to the inner wall with his right. The window was open to the elements: years ago the hay had been brought in through this opening for the winter. They had never bothered to put glass in the window. Each Bremont family member learned, as soon as they were tall enough to be able to reach the wrought-iron latch, how to open the window without falling out. The moonlight now filled up the room and would give him enough illumination to read what he had come for. The Louis Vuitton suitcase was on the floor near his right foot, and he picked it up and set it on the wooden dresser that was filled with moth-eaten blankets. The lock on the suitcase had been opened, probably by his brother, Fran�ois. He quickly opened the suitcase and grabbed the first papers that lay on top, flipping hurriedly through the documents. He didn&#x2019;t understand why he suddenly felt so rushed&#x2014;Jean-Claude was gone, an hour and a half away, until tomorrow&#x2014;but he was anxious all the same and couldn&#x2019;t stop his hands from shaking. The lawyers&#x2019; and notaries&#x2019; documents were handwritten, in the graceful script he and his brother were taught to use in the first grade, with fountain pens his father had bought at Michel on the cours Mirabeau. The papers were out of order, and mixed in with the legal documents were odd bits of paper that characterized his noble family&#x2019;s disregard for money, for filing, and for organization in general. Receipts had been kept in flour tins; hundred-franc bills were dropped or hidden under the library&#x2019;s faded Persian carpet; the electricity and telephone companies had to call regularly because of late payments, but they never dared to cut off the ch�teau&#x2019;s power.</p><p>He began separating the papers, dividing twenty-year-old bank statements and shopping lists from important legal documents. He laughed as he picked up a yellowed receipt from Aix&#x2019;s best p�tisserie, still in operation, with a fourth-generation chef doing the baking. The receipt was for two brioches, which could have been for him and Fran�ois, or Marine, except that it dated from the 1950s, years before any of them had been born. He held the receipt in his hands, calming down a bit and allowing himself to think again of Marine and their friendly preadolescent arguments over the merits of brioches versus croissants, or the chocolate powder Banania versus Quik. She could always outargue him.</p><p>�tienne de Bremont&#x2019;s smile froze when he heard the ch�teau&#x2019;s front door open. Instinct told him to stand closer to the wall, partly hiding his thin frame in the shadows. He took off his reading glasses and rested them inside his V-neck sweater. Footsteps quickly ran up the first flight of stairs, and then down the hall and up the second flight, down the next hall and up the last set of stairs, these narrower and wooden rather than stone. Holding his breath, �tienne reasoned that the footsteps probably belonged to Jean-Claude, who must have gotten it into his head that he couldn&#x2019;t possibly spend a night away from the ch�teau. His stupid plants would miss him too much. When the attic door opened, �tienne pointed his flashlight at the figure in the doorway; he sighed and said, &#x201c;What are <i>you</i> doing here?&#x201d;</p><p>The shutter rattled intermittently against the stone wall as �tienne spoke to his uninvited visitor; a strong wind had begun to blow, carrying their voices out the open window, over the pine trees, and up the hill toward the field of lavender.</p><p>As the wind grew louder so did their voices, now tinged with anger. �tienne, oddly enjoying the insults, imagined that he could smell lavender. He was getting bored with this exchange. For a split second, he turned his face toward the open window, in order to inhale the night breeze, and as he turned back around, he heard a rushing sound on the attic&#x2019;s wooden floor and felt hands on his chest. The mistral blew around his body as he fell. He looked up at the attic window and saw the faint light from his flashlight, and he heard the wind, not whistling, but groaning. Even in the few seconds before his death, all �tienne de Bremont could think of were those two brioches and how he had always preferred brioches to croissants.</p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p><i>Saint-Antonin, France</i></p><p>APRIL 17, 5:30 P.M.</p><p>Verlaque stood in front of the caretaker&#x2019;s house. It was a medieval cottage; its thick walls made of a golden, rough-hewed stone that glowed in the late afternoon light. The windows were small, to keep out the summer heat, and their wooden shutters were painted a faded gray-blue. Behind Verlaque loomed the mountain. He remembered what Paul C�zanne had said of the montagne Sainte-Victoire&#x2014;that he could move his easel half a meter and see a totally different mountain. Verlaque tried it now, shifting his heavy body slightly to the right. It worked. The spiky top of one of the mountain&#x2019;s many limestone knobs&#x2014;its south flank resembled a dinosaur&#x2019;s back&#x2014;came into view. A shadow suddenly floated across the peak, and its color changed from dusty rose to gray.</p><p>He turned back around and looked at the ch�teau, not really a ch�teau but a <i>bastide</i>&#x2014;a country home built by Aix-en-Provence&#x2019;s wealthy seventeenth-century citizens, who every July would leave their downtown mansions and make their way, servants in tow, to the cooler countryside. It <i>was</i> cold up here&#x2014;although less than ten kilometers from Aix, Saint-Antonin was five hundred meters above sea level&#x2014;and Verlaque realized that he had left his jacket in the car.</p><p>The <i>bastide</i>, like the cottage, was built of golden stone, but this stone had been smoothly cut. Giant yellow-and-green-glazed earthenware pots, now chipped and cracked, lined the pebbled walk that led to the front door. He noticed that despite the poor shape of the pots, each one contained a healthy oleander, not yet in bloom. Another pebbled walk, lined on either side with rows of lavender, cut across a manicured lawn and led down to a centuries-old ornamental pool. Verlaque walked down the path, aware of his newly acquired kilos and his stomach pushing against his Italian leather belt&#x2014;living alone didn&#x2019;t mean that he now ate less, as he imagined other bachelors did after a breakup. He sighed and promised himself that he would start running tomorrow, trying to think where his trainers might be. &#x201c;Trainers,&#x201d; he said aloud in English, and smiled. His English grandmother had called them &#x201c;trainers,&#x201d; and his French grandmother wouldn&#x2019;t let him leave the house with them on. &#x201c;Seulement pour le tennis,&#x201d; she would say.</p><p>The pool&#x2019;s water was green and murky and covered with leaves that had fallen from the plane trees that towered above it. At the far end was a fountain made from the bright orange and yellow marble that came from the mountain. It was in the shape of a lion&#x2019;s head whose mouth spewed water into the pool. When he first came to Provence, Verlaque didn&#x2019;t like the mont Sainte-Victoire marble&#x2014;he thought it too bright, almost kitsch&#x2014;but now he loved it. Marine&#x2019;s bathroom sink was made of the same marble. He reached down and put his hand under the running water and thought of some lines from a Philip Larkin poem, his preferred grandmother&#x2019;s preferred poet: &#x201c;I put my mouth / Close to running water: / Flow north, flow south, / It will not matter, / It is not love you will find.&#x201d; He had found love with Marine, but not contentment, and so he let the love go. His past was too difficult to explain to Marine, and the more she tried to get Verlaque to talk about it, the more he withdrew. It was easier to be on his own, in his loft, with his books and paintings and cigars. They hadn&#x2019;t spoken for over six months now.</p><p>&#x201c;Monsieur le Juge!&#x201d; cried a voice from the cottage. The caretaker was standing in the doorframe, his height and breadth filling it completely. &#x201c;The coffee is ready!&#x201d; Verlaque walked toward the cottage, at the same time slipping his hand into his pocket and turning on a tape recorder.</p><p>He tried not to shiver as he stood in the chilly kitchen. The caretaker, Jean-Claude Auvieux, began to serve coffee for the two of them. Judge Verlaque glanced around the frugally furnished and spotless room, taking time to admire the perfectly preserved flagstone floor. A stove dominated the room&#x2014;an old burgundy red La Cornue of the sort amateur chefs like Verlaque dreamed about. He would like to have one, with two ovens, at his home in Aix, but then he&#x2019;d have to redesign his entire flat. He rubbed his big hands together and resisted the temptation to blow on them.</p><p>Auvieux turned away from the stove and spoke to Verlaque, as if sensing the judge&#x2019;s discomfort. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry that it is so cold in here. I turned the heat off before I went away this weekend. It&#x2019;s warm enough during the day, but at night we still need to turn on the heat a bit, <i>non</i>? It will warm up soon.&#x201d; Auvieux was older than Verlaque, perhaps in his late forties, but his weathered face made him look even older. He was a huge man: tall and wide shouldered, with full lips and big brown eyes. He wore the usual dress for a Proven�al in his line of work: blue overalls and a quilted green hunting vest.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve had a rough Sunday,&#x201d; said Verlaque, pulling out a wooden chair and sitting down without invitation. &#x201c;What happened exactly?&#x201d;</p><p>Auvieux looked down at the floor, and then back at Verlaque, whose dark eyes were staring at him. &#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I found the body and called the police straightaway, and then&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were you alone?&#x201d; Verlaque interrupted. The caretaker froze, &#x201c;Yes, I was,&#x201d; he answered. He kicked at some imaginary dust on the floor.</p><p>Verlaque sighed and said, &#x201c;I realize that it must have been a terrible shock when you found Count de Bremont&#x2019;s body. I don&#x2019;t know if you were close to the count, but I know that you grew up here, with him and his family. Can you please tell me precisely what you did when you got back from the Var? Be as detailed as possible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got back to Saint-Antonin around noon today,&#x201d; answered Auvieux, after a short pause. &#x201c;Alone. I left my sister&#x2019;s house in the Var, near Cotignac, around ten thirty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need your sister&#x2019;s name and address, for our records,&#x201d; Verlaque interrupted.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Auvieux swallowed a bit, then breathed in and continued, &#x201c;I parked my car beside the cottage, to the right of the ch�teau. The car is still there. I brought my suitcase inside and then began to prepare a lunch for myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What exactly?&#x201d; asked Verlaque.</p><p>&#x201c;My lunch?&#x201d; Auvieux stared at the judge for a few seconds, trying to understand the line of questioning, and then shrugged. He had long ago given up trying to understand people. Plants were so much easier. Verlaque, in fact, had already noticed a bowl full of strawberries and some thin green asparagus sitting on the counter, waiting for that night&#x2019;s dinner. When Auvieux opened the fridge to get the milk, Verlaque had quickly taken an inventory: eggs, a half-eaten goat&#x2019;s cheese, a salami wrapped in plastic, butter, mineral water, and white wine. Just about the same things that were in Verlaque&#x2019;s fridge at home. Minus the Pol Roger champagne. The caretaker finally answered, &#x201c;Um, I fried a steak, an entrec�te, and I had a salad, a green salad. Plus two glasses of red wine. I buy the wine in bulk from the cooperative in Puyloubier. It&#x2019;s not bad, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Verlaque smiled a warm, genuine smile. He knew that cooperative&#x2019;s wine, and the caretaker was right&#x2014;for a wine that cost less than three euros a liter, it really wasn&#x2019;t bad. &#x201c;What time did you finish eating?&#x201d; Verlaque continued.</p><p>&#x201c;Around two o&#x2019;clock. After lunch I changed into my work clothes, and I took my walk&#x2014;I like to walk after lunch, even a fifteen-minute walk is beneficial to the health. My sister saw a <i>reportage</i> on it. Fifteen minutes is all you need.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s what they say,&#x201d; Verlaque answered, starting to grow impatient again.</p><p>&#x201c;And so I walked along there,&#x201d; continued Auvieux, gesturing with his hand toward the ch�teau, which could be seen from his kitchen window, &#x201c;through the olive grove. I took a few minutes to check the trees&#x2014;I&#x2019;d cut them back in February. Count de Bremont, that is, Mr. �tienne&#x2019;s grandfather, used to tell me that the branches should be pruned enough so that one still had a clear view of montagne Sainte-Victoire through the trees.&#x201d;</p><p>At this point the caretaker stopped and looked at the judge, as if waiting for an answer.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard that too,&#x201d; Verlaque found himself saying. It took him a few seconds to realize that it was Marine who had told him, while clipping the olive tree on her terrace one sunny morning. There wasn&#x2019;t a view of the mountain from her downtown apartment, but in the early twentieth century there had been glorious views, before the tall apartment buildings were built on the outskirts of Aix, and so the expression had stuck. Verlaque remembered seeing C�zanne&#x2019;s many studies of the mountain, done from his studio located on a hill north of Aix. Today those views were hidden behind cube-shaped concrete apartment blocks. It seemed fitting to Verlaque that not only could C�zanne&#x2019;s mountain <i>not </i>be seen from the painter&#x2019;s stud...</p></p><h2>The Flowers of Vashnoi</h2><p>Still new to her duties as Lady Vorkosigan, Ekaterin is working together with expatriate scientist Enrique Borgos on a radical scheme to recover the lands of the Vashnoi exclusion zone, lingering radioactive legacy of the Cetagandan invasion of the planet Barrayar.

Deathbird Stories is a collection of 19 of Harlan Ellison&#39;s best stories, including Edgar and Hugo winners, originally published between 1960 and 1974. The collection contains some of Ellison&#39;s best stories from earlier collections and is judged by some to be his most consistently high quality collection of short fiction. The theme of the collection can be loosely defined as God, or Gods. Sometimes they&#39;re dead or dying, some of them are as brand-new as today&#39;s technology. Unlike some of Ellison&#39;s collections, the introductory notes to each story can be as short as a phrase and rarely run more than a sentence or two. One story took a Locus Poll Award, the two final ones both garnered Hugo Awards and Locus Poll awards, and the final one also received a Jupiter Award from the Instructors of Science Fiction in Higher Education (discontinued in 1979). When the collection was published in Britain, it won the 1979 British Science Fiction Award for Short Fiction.

In a career spanning more than fifty years, he has won more awards than any other living fantasist. Ellison has written or edited one hundred fourteen books; more than seventeen hundred stories, essays, articles, and newspaper columns; two dozen teleplays; and a dozen motion pictures. He has won the Hugo Award eight and a half times (shared once); the Nebula Award three times; the Bram Stoker Award, presented by the Horror Writers Association, five times (including the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996); the Edgar Award of the Mystery Writers of America twice; the Georges Melies Fantasy Film Award twice; and two Audie Awards (for the best in audio recordings); and he was awarded the Silver Pen for Journalism by PEN, the international writers&#x2019; union. He was presented with the first Living Legend Award by the International Horror Critics at the 1995 World Horror Convention. Ellison is the only author in Hollywood ever to win the Writers Guild of America award for Outstanding Teleplay (solo work) four times, most recently for &#x201c;Paladin of the Lost Hour,&#x201d; his <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode that was Danny Kaye&#x2019;s final role, in 1987.

They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character, Asterix, along with his friend Obelix have various adventures. In many cases, this leads them to travel to various countries around the world, though other books are set in and around their village.

Julie D'Acci illuminates the tensions between the television industry, the series production team, the mainstream and feminist press, various interest groups, and television viewers over competing notions of what women could or could not be--not only on television but in society at large. <i>Cagney and Lacey</i>, which aired from 1981 to 1988, was widely recognized as an innovative treatment of working women and developed a large and loyal following. While researching this book, D'Acci had unprecedented access to the set, to production meetings, and to the complete production files, including correspondence from network executives, publicity firms, and thousands of viewers. She traces the often heated debates surrounding the development of women characters and the representation of feminism on prime-time television, shows how the series was reconfigured as a 'woman's program,' and investigates questions of female spectatorship and feminist readings. Although she focuses on <i>Cagney and Lacey</i>, D'Acci discusses many other examples from the history of American television.<br><br></p><p>"Anyone who deems TV programming 'too trivial' for scholarly analysis will stand corrected after reading Julie D'Acci's fascinating case study of the rise and fall of the prime-time feminist-minded drama, <i>Cagney and Lacey</i>. Unlike most media studies scholars, who rarely venture beyond textual analysis, D'Acci takes the time to go behind the scenes. . . . The result is a meticulous, thought-provoking, and nuanced look at the ways in which TV, its audience, and its advertisers shape and reshape each other's visions of womanhood."--Susan Faludi, author of <i>Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women</i> <br>Focusing on the pioneering television series 'Cagney &amp; Lacey, ' which starred two women as New York City police detectives, Julie D'Acci illuminates the tensions between the television industry, the series production team, the mainstream and feminist press, various interest groups, and television viewers over competing notions of what women could or could not be-not only on television but in society at large.</p><h2>The Last Generation: Prose and Poetry</h2><p>A classic work by award-winning author Cherr�e Moraga, <i>The Last Generation</i> is an electric mix of prose and poetry that continues conversations started in the beloved books <i>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color</i> and <i>Loving in the War Years: Lo que nunca pas� por sus labios.</i> Highly politicized and intensely personal, Moraga's work dares to imagine the mythic nation Queer Atzl�n: a brave vision for gender, sexuality, race, art, nationalism, and the politics of liberation. Moraga crosses literary genres to ruminate on the paradox of being at once inside and outside the myriad struggles and communities&#x2014;interlocking and often at odds&#x2014;that spur her art and activism. Speaking from her experience as a queer Chicana activist/artist, Moraga is committed to building a broad politic of solidarity and justice for all dispossessed people.<br><br>With fierce honesty and incisive political analysis, Moraga offers more than an inspiring portrait of the struggle of an activist artist&#x2014;she helps us see the world as it is and dream it up anew.</p><p>One of the most influential feminist thinkers of her generation, Cherr�e Moraga is the award-winning author of <i>Loving in the War Years: Lo que nunca pas� por sus labios</i> and co-editor, with Gloria Anzald�a, of <i>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.</i> A renowned playwright, Moraga is currently artist-in-residence at Stanford University.The product of a white father and a Mexican mother, playwright Moraga describes herself as a "mongrel" and knows "full well that my mestizaje--my breed blood--is the catalyst of my activism and my art." As a radical lesbian feminist, she is alienated from her cousins with their children and pregnant wives. She views the Chicano movement as sexist, stemming from a culture in which rape, incest, battered women and drug abuse are the norm. The dichotomy of her existence is underscored, she believes, by the U.S. role in supporting dictatorships in Latin America. Essays form the bulk of this debut collection, while a few interwoven poems provide a lyrical break from her heavily polemical tone. At its best, her prose contains the same heartfelt revelations that make her poems memorable, as in a sexually explicit account of her first schoolgirl crush. "In love, color blurs but never wholly disappears," she writes in another essay that delineates her lovers by race. Her longing for a day when such a statement will no longer be applicable provides a utopian undercurrent to the collection. Moraga is co-editor of This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The SS Dirlewanger: The History of the Black Hunters</h2><p>The Dirlewanger Brigade was an anti-partisan unit of the Nazi army, reporting directly to Heinrich Himmler, whose first members were mostly poachers, released from prisons and concentration camps because they were believed to have the &#39;skills&#39; necessary for hunting and capturing partisan fighters in the forests of the eastern front. Their numbers were soon increased by others who were eager for a way out of imprisonment-including men who had been convicted of burglary, assault, murder and rape. Under the leadership of Oscar Dirlewanger, a convicted rapist and alcoholic, the men of the brigade could do as they pleased: there were no repercussions for even their worst behaviour. This was the group used for it&#39;s special &#39;talents&#39; to help put down the Warsaw uprising in 1944 killing and estimated 35,000 men, women and children in one day. Even by Nazi standards, the brigade was considered unduly violent. An investigation of its activities was opened and many of the men were exiled to Belarus. Based on the archives from Germany, Poland and Russia, &#34;The SS Dirlewanger Brigade&#34; offers an unprecedented look at one of the darkest chapters of World War II history.</p><p>Christian Ingrao is director of research at the institute of History of Present Times.

Part travelogue, part cookbook, part naturalist&#39;s encounter, and part love letter, Kaminsky&#39;s book takes us from Kentucky, Burgundy, and Madrid to the Yucatn and back to Brooklyn to tell the tale of the pig. From the wondrous techniques of tailgate chefs to Mayan home cooking, competitive barbecuing, and the ancient rite of the pig killing that has bound communities together over the centuries, Pig Perfect brings together an oddball pork-loving band of chefs, farmers, and food lovers and offers a tasty history of the oft underappreciated pig.</p><p><strong>Peter Kaminsky</strong> is the author of numerous books, including <em>The Moon Pulled Up an Acre of Bass</em>, <em>Pig Perfect</em>, and <em>The Elements of Taste</em>.

His work has appeared frequently in <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> and <em>Field &amp; Stream</em>, and he was managing editor of <em>National Lampoon</em>. He lives in Brooklyn.In this sprawling love letter to hogdom, "hamthropologist" and food and fly fishing writer Kaminsky takes readers to France and Spain as well as to such American cities as Memphis, Louisville and Des Moines to visit a broad variety of pork-related venues. He waxes ecstatic about long-aged country ham and laments today's leaner, less flavorful meat. He seeks out a pig slaughter, considers why pork is taboo to Jews and Muslims, and excoriates the brutality and environmental damage wreaked by hog factories. Kaminsky (<i>The Moon Pulled Up an Acre of Bass</i>) celebrates family farmers who give their pigs freedom in the field, offer them natural foods and produce a far better pork. The author's enthusiasm is infectious, but since he races all over the map, the chatty accounts of his various adventures and the people he meets along the way are often fleeting as well. The narrative is, however, generously embellished with dozens of facts about pigs (such as the staggering statistic that about 350,000 U.S. hogs are slaughtered every week). Nine recipes, ranging from Country Ham Braised in Cider and Molasses to Emile and Rachel's Roast Loin of Pork with Greens and Cantaloupe, are scattered throughout to honor the oinker itself. <i>Agent, Lisa Queen at IMG.

Bush comes a definitive, thought-provoking blueprint of Bush&#39;s philosophy of government, one that argues that religious faith is essential to promote welfare programs.</p><p>If 2000 Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has a catchphrase, it's "compassionate conservatism." But like so many political slogans, this term can mean very different things. Marvin Olasky--author of <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i> and an advisor to Bush--seeks to describe what he believes it is. And he must be onto something, for, as Bush writes in a brief introduction, "This book clearly summarizes the principles of compassionate conservatism." Here's the nub: "Poverty around the world is a spiritual as well as a material problem: most poor people don't have the faith that they and their situations can change.... Economic redistribution by itself cannot fight poverty effectively because it does not affect the attitudes that frequently undergird poverty." To put it more bluntly, religious faith should play a greater role in public life, especially when it comes to delivering social services to the deprived: <blockquote>The major flaw of the modern welfare state is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy. It gives the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone. It gives the rest of us the opportunity to be stingy also, and to salve our consciences even as we scrimp on what many of the destitute need most--love, time, and a challenge to be "little lower than the angels" rather than one thumb up from monkeys.</blockquote> The bulk of the book is given to descriptions of Olasky's travels around the country with his 10-year-old son, visiting faith-based organizations in some of America's toughest neighborhoods. These vignettes, told in the first person, recall feel-good <i>Reader's Digest</i> stories about ordinary men and women accomplishing extraordinary things in some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable. Parts of the book read like a Bush campaign speech--indeed, one of the appendices <i>is</i> a Bush campaign speech--and Olasky goes out of his way to take a few swipes at Vice President Al Gore. If readers want to get a sense of what a Bush administration might try to accomplish, at least on the domestic front, <i>Compassionate Conservatism</i> is a great place to start--and miles ahead of Bush's own dull campaign biography <i>A Charge to Keep</i>. <i>--John J.

Hauschka takes a radically different approach, viewing matter&#x2015;and food in particular&#x2015;as having a spiritual aspect. From this holistic perspective he presents a new, practical approach to nutrition. <br><br>his classic work is the result of Dr Hauschka&#x2019;s many years&#x2019; research at the Ita Wegman Clinic in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Through active experimentation, Hauschka found fresh insight into the principles of digestion, which enabled him to evolve a system of nutrition suitable for the present day. <br><br>In an age of mass food production, Hauschka considers one of the most neglected aspects of nutrition&#x2015;food quality. He discusses aspects of food that can be measured by conventional scientific means, as well as aspects that defy quantification by the usual methods. He relates these findings to a historical survey of food cultivation, preparation, and preservation, as well as to the question of today&#x2019;s chemically treated foods. <br><br>In the present climate of food scares and concerns&#x2015;BSE, foot and mouth disease, genetic modification, chemical poisoning, etc&#x2015;Hauschka&#x2019;s book takes on a new relevance, adding a significant contribution to the current debate. Also included are concise dietary suggestions by Dr Margarethe Hauschka for healthy as well as sick people. <br><br>This book is a companion volume to the author&#x2019;s other work, <i>The Nature of Substance</i>.</p><p><b>Dr. Rudolf Hauschka,</b> a chemist, asked Dr. Rudolf Steiner in 1923, &#x201c;What is life?&#x201d; Steiner&#x2019;s answer was: &#x201c;Study rhythms, rhythm supports life!&#x201d; Soon after receiving this answer, Hauschka was asked by Dr. Ita Wegmann to research and study the rhythms in nature at her institute in Arlesheim, Switzerland. After many attempts and a new understanding of the processes in the plant world, he produced a plant extract from rhythmized rose water, which could be kept stable for more than thirty years. Today WALA, a manufacturer of anthroposophical medicines and skin-care products, is based on Hauschka's discoveries.</p><h2>The dance bands</h2><p>collectible</p><p></p><h2>Hidden Jewel (Landry Series)</h2><p>Sheltered from sorrow, innocent young Pearl thrives in the sunshine of a loving home... except for the haunting nightmares of her earliest years, and the dark family secrets she worries will one day shadow her destiny...<br>Raised in a New Orleans mansion filled with kindness and laughter, Pearl dreams of becoming a doctor.

The text is full of McDonagh's characteristic combination of farce, aggression and wit. The plot follows two brothers, Valene and Coleman, living alone in their father's house after his recent death. They find it impossible to exist without massive and violent disputes over the most mundane and innocent of topics. Only Father Welsh, the local young priest, is prepared to try to reconcile the two before their petty squabblings spiral into vicious and bloody carnage.</p><p>Martin McDonagh is the most controversial Irish dramatist working today, with his explorations of Irish national identity which look at the darker side of provincial life.

Twenty years later, he has transformed the land adjoining the house into several exquisite gardens which embody his gardening ideals and organic principles. With help from some of Britain&#39;s finest designers, including The Marchioness of Salisbury, Rosemary Verey, Miriam Rothschild and Sir Roy Strong, the Prince of Wales has created highly individual gardens which have now, with his own ideas, reached maturity. The Prince of Wales describes the thinking behind each garden, the mistakes and the triumphs, and his plans for the future. Lavishly illustrated with photographs which capture both the scope and detail of each garden, this is a book which will delight and inspire both gardeners and horticulturalists at every level.</p><p>S In his previous book, The Prince of Wales described how he had spent eleven years turning his Cotswold estate into a model of environmentally benign farming and gardening. In this book he describes how his gardens have been conceived, developed and planted. Candida Lycett Green has published twelve books, and introduced and edited two volumes of her father, Sir John Betjeman&#39;s letters. She has written and presented three television documentaries, including The Front Garden and A Cottage in the Country. She is a commissioner for English Heritage.Prince Charles is renowned for his views on organic gardening and his passion extends very firmly to his home, Highgrove, deep in the Gloucestershire countryside. A barren landscape bar the grandiose Cedar of Lebanon which initially caught the Prince&#39;s eye, it has, since 1980, been transformed by this remarkable, unassuming man into one of the greatest gardens of our time. In close consultation with designers such as Rosemary Verey, Miriam Rothschild and Sir Roy Strong, he has developed a garden that is an important part of Britain&#39;s heritage. Totally organically managed, Highgrove is a testament to the Prince&#39;s &#34;green&#34; beliefs and a wake-up call to all non-believers - a garden of Eden in the midst of a polluted world. This gloriously illustrated book is full of photographs by renowned photographers Andrew Lawson and Christopher Simon Sykes whose styles perfectly capture the essence of the place from the kitchen gardens to the woodland, the terraces to the wildflower meadows. Accompanied by the expert text of Candida Lycett Green, this is a fitting eulogy giving a readable and enjoyable picture of the thought, work and future hopes for Highgrove by the Prince and his gardeners. - Lucy Watson</p><h2>Embrace the Night</h2><p>A creature doomed to wander the earth in eternal darkness, he searches for someone to share the endless night of his existence, for that one woman who would recognize the man within the monster.

Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>At the funeral home the friend of the deceased was a big, richly dressed man who looked like a professional wrestler. He was wearing expensive clothing and a cashmere coat. He had olive skin, black eyes and wavy black hair that he wore in a long ponytail. He stood over the casket without saying a word. He looked aloof. He looked dangerous. He hadn't spoken to anyone since he entered the building.<br><br>Tony Danzetta stared down at John Hamilton's casket with an expression like stone, although he was raging inside. It was hard to look at the remains of a man he'd known and loved since high school. His best friend was dead. Dead, because of a woman.<br><br>Tony's friend, Frank Mariott, had phoned him at the home of the man he was working for temporarily in Ja-cobsville, Texas. Tony had planned to stay around for a little longer, take a few weeks off from work before he went back to his real job. But the news about John had sent him rushing home to San Antonio.<br><br>Of the three of them, John had been the weak link. The other two were always forced to save him from himself. He fantasized about people and places that he considered were part of his life. Often the people were shocked to learn that he was telling his friends that he was on close terms with them.<br><br>Tony and Frank thought that John was harmless. He just wanted to be somebody. He was the son of people who worked for a local clothing manufacturing company. When the company moved outside the United States, they went to work at retail stores. Neither of them finished high school, but John often made up stories to tell classmates about his famous rich parents who had a yacht and their own airplane. Tony and Frank knew better, but they let him spin his yarns. They understood him.<br><br>But now John was dead, and that... woman was responsible! He could still see her face from the past, red with embarrassment when she'd asked him about one of their assignments at the adjunct college class they were both taking in criminal justice. That had been six years ago. She couldn't even talk to a man without stammering and shaking. Millie Evans had mousy-brown hair and green eyes. She wore glasses. She was thin and unremarkable. But Tony's adopted foster mother, who had been an archivist at the local library, was Millicent Evans's superior and she liked Millie. She was always talking about her to Tony, pushing her at him, right up until the day she died.<br><br>Tony couldn't have told his foster mother, but he knew too much about the girl to be interested in her. John had become fixated on her a couple of years ago and during one of Tony's rare visits home, had told him about her alter ego. In private, he said, Millie was hot. Give her a couple of beers and she'd do anything a man wanted her to do. That prim, nervous pose was just that&#x2014;a pose. She wasn't shy and retiring. She was a party girl. She'd even done a threesome with him and their friend Frank, he'd told Tony in confidence. Don't mention that to Frank, though, he'd added, because Frank was still embarrassed about it.<br><br>What Tony had learned about Millie Evans had turned him right off her. Not that he'd found her attractive before that. She was another in a long line of dull, staid spinsters who'd do anything to get a man. Poor John. He'd felt sorry for his friend, because John was obsessed with Millicent Evans. To John, Millie was the queen of Sheba, the ultimate female. Sometimes she loved him, John moaned, but other times she treated him like a complete stranger. Other times, she complained that he was stalking her. Ridiculous, John had told Tony. As if he had to stalk her, when she was often waiting for him at his apartment, when he got off from work as a night watchman, wearing nothing at all!<br><br>John's description of the spinster was incomprehensible to Tony, who'd had beautiful, intelligent, wealthy women after him. He'd never had to chase a woman. Mil-licent Evans had no looks, no personality and she seemed rather dull witted. He never had been able to understand what John saw in her.<br><br>Now John was dead. Millicent Evans had driven him to suicide. Tony stared at the pale, lifeless face and rage built inside him. What sort of woman used a man like that, abused his love to the extent that she caused him to take his own life?<br><br>The funeral director had a phone call, which forced him to approach the silent man in the viewing room. He paused beside him. "Would you be Mr. Danzetta?" the man asked respectfully. The caller had identified him as tall and unconventional looking. That was an understatement. Up close, the man was enormous, and those black eyes cut like a diamond.<br><br>"I'm Tony Danzetta," he replied in a deep, gravelly voice.<br><br>"Your friend Mr. Mariott just phoned to tell us to expect you. He said you had a special request about the burial?"<br><br>"Yes," Tony told him. In his cashmere coat, that reached down to his ankles, he looked elegant. "I have two plots in a perpetual care cemetery just outside San Antonio, a short distance from where my foster mother is buried. I'd like you to put John in one of them." He was remembering a hill in Cherokee, North Carolina, where his mother was buried and a cemetery in Atlanta that held the remains of his father and his younger sister. He'd been in San Antonio since junior high school, with his foster mother. He described the plots, one of which he intended for John. "I have a plat of the location in my safe-deposit box. If I could drop it by in the morning?"<br><br>"Today would be better," the man replied apologetically. "We have to get our people to open the grave and prepare it for the service on the day after tomorrow, you understand."<br><br>He was juggling appointments, one of which was with his banker about a transfer of funds. But he smiled, as if it was of no consequence. He could get the plat out of the box while he was doing business at the bank. "No problem. I'll drop it by on my way to the hotel tonight."<br><br>"Thank you. That will save us a bit of bother."<br><br>Tony looked down at John. "You did a good job," he said quietly. "He looks... the way he used to look."<br><br>The man smiled broadly.<br><br>Tony looked at his watch. "I have to go. I'll be back when I've finished my business in town."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"If Frank shows up before I get back, tell him that, will you? And tell him not to go out for food. I'll take him out to eat tonight."<br><br>"I will."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>The funeral director walked out of the viewing room, pausing to speak to someone. Tony, his eyes resting sadly on his friend's face, only half noticed the conversation.<br><br>He heard soft footsteps come toward the casket and pause beside him. He turned his head. And there she was. The culprit herself. She'd be twenty-six now, he judged, and she was no more attractive than she'd been all those years ago. She dressed better. She was wearing a neat gray suit with a pink blouse and a thick dark coat. Her dark brown hair was in a bun. She was wearing contacts in her green eyes, he imagined, because his foster mother had often mentioned how nearsighted she was. The lack of glasses didn't help her to look any prettier. She had a nice mouth and good skin, but she held no attraction for Tony. Especially after she'd been responsible for his best friend's death.<br><br>"I'm very sorry," she said quietly. She looked at John with no visible sign of emotion. "I never meant it to end like this."<br><br>"Didn't you?" He turned, his hands in the pockets of his coat, as he glared down at her with piercing dark eyes. "Teasing him for years, playing hard to get, then calling the police to have him arrested as a stalker? And you didn't mean it to end like this?"<br><br>She felt cold all over. She knew he'd worked in construction years ago, but there had been rumors about him since, whispers. Dark whispers. John had intimated that Tony was into illegal operations, that he'd killed men. Looking into his black eyes now, she could believe it. He wasn't the man she'd known. What had he said about her teasing John?<br><br>"Don't bother to lie," he said icily, cutting off her question even before it got out of her mouth. "John told me all about you."<br><br>Her eyebrows arched. What was there to tell, except that his friend John had almost destroyed her life? She drew herself up straighter. "Yes, he was quite good at telling people about me," she began.<br><br>"I never could understand what he saw in you," he continued, his voice as pleasant as his eyes were homicidal. "You're nothing to look at. I wouldn't give you a second look if you were dripping diamonds."<br><br>That hurt. She tried not to let it show, but it did. God knew what John had told him.<br><br>"I...have to go," she stammered. She was no good at confrontations. This big man was looking for a fight. Millie had no weapons against him. Long ago, the spirit had been beaten out of her.<br><br>"What, no urge to linger and gloat over your triumph?" He laughed coldly. "The man is dead. You drove him to suicide!"<br><br>She turned, her heart breaking, and met the tall man's eyes. "You and Frank could never see it," she replied.<br><br>"You wouldn't see it. Other men have infatuations. John had obsessions. He was arrested other times for stalking women&#x2014;"<br><br>"I imagine you put the women up to reporting him," he interrupted. "John said you'd accuse him of stalking and then be waiting for him at his apartment, wearing no clothes at all."<br><br>She didn't seem surprised at the comment. He couldn't know that she was used to John's accusations. Much too used to them for comfort.<br><br>She moved one shoulder helplessly. "I tried to make him get help. When I finally had him arrested, I spoke to the district attorney myself and requested that they give him a psychiatric evaluation. John refused it."<br><br>"Of course he refused it. There was nothing wrong with his mind!" he shot back. "Unless you could call being infatuated with you a psychiatric problem." He raised both eyebrows. "Hell, I'd call it one!"<br><br>"Call it whatever you like," she said wearily. She glanced once more at John and turned away from the casket.<br><br>"Don't bother coming to the funeral," he said coldly. "You won't be welcome."<br><br>"Don't worry, I hadn't planned to," she replied.<br><br>He took a quick step toward her, infuriated by her lukewarm attitude, his dark eyes blazing with fury.<br><br>She gasped, dropped her purse and jumped back away from him. Her face was white.<br><br>Surprised, he stopped in his tracks.<br><br>She bent and scrambled for her purse, turned and ran out of the room.<br><br>There were murmurs outside the room. He glanced back at John, torn between anger and grief. "God, I'm sorry," he said softly to his friend. "I'm so sorry!"<br><br>He forced himself to leave. The funeral director was standing at the front door, looking worried.<br><br>"The young lady was very upset," he said uneasily. "White as a sheet and crying."<br><br>"I'm sure she was grieving for John," Tony said nonchalantly. "They knew each other a long time."<br><br>"Oh. That would explain it, then."<br><br>Tony walked to his car and felt better. At least he'd dragged some emotion out of her on behalf of his friend. He got behind the wheel of his expensive sports car and revved it out of the funeral home parking lot, his mind already on his appointment with the bank.<br><br>Millie Evans sat at the wheel of her little black VW Beetle and watched Tony drive away, out of her life. She was still crying. His coldness, his fury, had hurt her. She'd had to deal with John's histrionics and threats for two years, watching her life and career go down the drain while he told lies about her to anyone gullible enough to listen. He'd persecuted her, tormented her, made a hell of her daily life. Now he was dead, and Tony wanted to make her pay for driving his poor, helpless friend to suicide.<br><br>She wiped at her eyes with a handkerchief. Poor friend, the devil! Perhaps if he and Frank had realized that John was mentally ill years ago, they might have made him get help. He might have straightened out his life and gone on.<br><br>Millie was secretly relieved that John hadn't carried out his last, furious threat to end her life. He'd told her that she wouldn't get away with rejecting him. He had friends, he told her, who wouldn't hesitate to kill her for the right amount of money. He had savings, he'd raged; he'd use it all. He'd make sure she didn't live to gloat about pushing him out of her life!<br><br>She'd worried about that threat. The news was full of people who'd gone off the deep end and killed others they blamed for their problems, before killing themselves. It was, sadly, a fact of modern life. But she'd never dreamed that she&#x2014;plain, prim little Millie Evans&#x2014;would ever have something like that happen to her. Most people never even noticed her.<br><br>She'd wanted to be noticed by Tony. She'd loved him forever, it seemed. While his foster mother was alive, she'd coaxed the older woman into talking about her adoptive son. Tony had come a long way from North Carolina. He and his sister, both Cherokee, had lived with their mother and her abusive husband&#x2014;but not their biological father&#x2014;in Atlanta just briefly, but the man drank to excess and was brutal to the children.<br><br></p><h2>A Hard Day&#39;s Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles&#39; Song</h2><p>A lavishly illustrated, rollicking account of the real people and events that inspired the Beatles' lyrics. <p> Who was "just seventeen" and made Paul's heart go "boom"? Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where's Penny Lane? In <i>A Hard Day's Write, </i> music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four's rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles' music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture's collective imagination. </p><p> Arranged chronologically by album, the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group's writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York 'speech doctor'; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer, Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs, probed public records and newspaper archives, and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public. The result is a book that chronicles an untold story of the Beatles themselves. </p><p> Illustrated with over 200 photographs, <i>A Hard Day's Write</i> is a visually alluring and highly entertaining journey to the land stretching just beneath your conscious mind, mapped out with strawberry fields, fool-topped hills, and long and winding roads.</p></p><p>Steve Turner is the author of <i>Trouble Man: The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye, A Hard Day's, Write: The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song, Hungry for Heaven: Rock and Roll and the Search for Redemption, Jack Kerouac.

There's a trespassing little girl, for starters, who barges into the bears' house uninvited and not only snoops around, but eats the bears' food! The suspense of wondering whether she'll get caught only adds to the thrill of the trespassing itself, and the repeated lines about the three bears with their three distinct voices, bowls, chairs, and beds further endear this tale to the preschool set. In Jan Brett's <i>Goldilocks</i>, the bears and the slightly audacious flaxen-haired heroine all sport traditional (Black Forest?) costumes with detailed embroidery, and the wooden furniture is carved with bears, birds, and flowers. (Intricate borders--carved wooden panels in this book--are Jan Brett's special signature.) Brett is the illustrator of many well-known folk tales, fairy tales, and poems, such as <i>The Mitten</i> and Edward Lear's <i>The Owl and the Pussycat</i>. Of her exquisite interpretation of this beloved story, <i>Booklist</i> writes, "This is perfection." <i>(Ages 3 to 6)</i><p>With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books. Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.</p> <p>As a child, Jan Brett decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, "I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real."</p> <p>As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. "It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain," she says. "I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting."</p> <p>Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. "From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books."</p></p><h2>Where&#39;s Asterix?</h2><p>Can you find Asterix, Obelix, and their friends?

Kurt Spellmeyer references the Bible, popular culture, Zen, and Western philosophy in addressing two questions: how did we get here, and what can we do now. An answer to pervasive cynicism and decline, <i>Buddha at the Apocalypse</i> shows how to accept and connect with reality in dark times.</p><p>Kurt Spellmeyer is an award-winning teacher and scholar in the English department at Rutgers University in New Jersey and a Rinzai Zen Master. He is the author of <i>Arts of Living: Reinventing the Humanities for the Twenty-First Century</i> and several other books."The self-centered dream from which Kurt Spellmeyer strives to awaken us is not simply the dream of our individual ego but the dream of history. We must awaken from time itself, from beginnings, from progress, from goals and from visions of the end of time. Buddha at the Apocalypse challenges our assumptions about who we are, where we come from and where we are going, in our life and in our practice." Author: Barry Magid, author of Ending the Pursuit of Happiness<br><br>"<i>Buddha at the Apocalypse</i> is easy-going, well written, and solidly reasoned--and lively in the way it interweaves Biblical analysis, Zen literature, and Western philosophy and sociology with popular culture and deep wisdom. I am delighted to greet this important and meaningful work and wish its author and many readers a fruitful walk in its garden of perceptive insights and heartfelt advice." Author: Robert Thurman<br><br>"Buddha at the Apocalypse is a bold investigation into the role of religion in the creation of the environmental crisis. Spellmeyer is refreshingly direct in his evaluations, writing a manifesto of environmentally concerned Buddhism. His writing is crisp and honest, raising hard questions that help us confront the highly politicized role of religion as an ecological force." Author: Richard K. Payne, editor of How Much is Enough?<br><br>"So often we see the future as something that will save us from the present--but what if our attempts to 'save the world' are based on the very way of seeing that is destroying it? Spellmeyer invites the reader to look differently at the nature of time itself, especially our belief in the inevitable benefits of Progress. A challenging and provocative book." Author: David R. Loy, author of Money Sex War Karma and The World Is Made of Stories<br><br>"Spellmeyer's <i>Buddha at the Apocalypse</i> opposes two conceptions of time: the endgame finality of the Western traditions, and the no-game now here-all of Buddhism. He speaks for a crucial shift in attitude towards the world and our human place in it. We are not, he asserts, bound for destruction, but bound by illusions obscuring an interpenetrating infinitely complex plenitude of miraculous being in which time and self are variables. This is no mystical diatribe, but a gentle reflection by the light of a Zen moon which shows how the whole show is alive, how we cannot save the world, nor fundamentally destroy it, but how with compassion we can embrace our shared being. How we connect with each other this moment and this day is the world, even as the static moment flows away in a march of moments, yet here still moment unending. Spellmeyer speaks for a profoundly simple ecology of mind, where world and mind are seamlessly one, and your acts and mine do make a difference." Author: Robert Langan<br><br>"This book helped me to see our western culture more clearly, and inspired me to rebel against the Apocolyptic paradigm with renewed vigor." Author: Noah Levine, author of Dharma Punx and Against the Stream</p><h2>The One-Eyed Man: A Fugue, With Winds and Accompaniment</h2><p><p>The colony world of Stittara is no ordinary planet. For the interstellar Unity of the Ceylesian Arm, Stittara is the primary source of anagathics: drugs that have more than doubled the human life span. But the ecological balance that makes anagathics possible on Stittara is fragile, and the Unity government has a vital interest in making sure the flow of longevity drugs remains uninterrupted, even if it means uprooting the human settlements.</p><p>Offered the job of assessing the ecological impact of the human presence on Stittara, freelance consultant Dr. Paulo Verano jumps at the chance to escape the ruin of his personal life. He gets far more than he bargained for: Stittara's atmosphere is populated with skytubes&#x2015;gigantic, mysterious airborne organisms that drift like clouds above the surface of the planet. Their exact nature has eluded humanity for centuries, but Verano believes his conclusions about Stittara may hinge on understanding the skytubes' role in the planet's ecology&#x2015;if he survives the hurricane winds, distrustful settlers, and secret agendas that impede his investigation at every turn.</p><p><i>The One-Eyed Man is </i>a thrilling new far-future science fiction novel from <i>New York Times </i>bestseller L.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Court procedures on Bachman were old-fashioned, requiring all parties be present. So there I was, after two hours of evidence and testimony, on one side of the courtroom, standing beside my advocate, Jared Hainsun, before the judge&#x2019;s bench, and on the other side was Chelesina, with her advocate. Chelesina didn&#x2019;t look in my direction. That didn&#x2019;t surprise me. For the three years before she left, she&#x2019;d barely looked at me even when she&#x2019;d been looking at me. That didn&#x2019;t bother me so much as the way she&#x2019;d set me up after she&#x2019;d split&nbsp;&#x2026; so that the only option was no fault. <br>The judge looked at me. I could have sworn that the quick glance she gave me was almost pitying. I didn&#x2019;t need that. Then she cleared her throat and spoke. &#x201c;In the proceeding for dissolution of permanent civil union between the party of the first part, Chelesina Fhavour, and the party of the second part, Paulo Verano, the Court of Civil Matters, of the Unity of the Ceylesian Arm, located in the city of Smithsen, world of Bachman, does hereby decree that said civil union is hereby dissolved.&#x201d; <br>She barely paused before going on. &#x201c;In the matter of property allocation, the net worth of the assets of both parties has been assessed at five point eight million duhlars. The settlement to the party of the first part, Chelesina Fhavour, is four point one million duhlars, of which three million has been placed in an irrevocable trust for the daughter of the union, Leysa Fhavour, said trust to be administered by the Bank of Smithsen until Leysa Fhavour reaches legal civil and political maturity&#x2026;&#x201d; <br> <i>At least, Chelesina can&#x2019;t easily get her hands on that.</i> <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; Civil penalties for breach of union are one point five million duhlars, to be split between you, as mandated under the laws of the Unity. The remainder of all assets is allocated to the party of the second part, Paulo Verano. <br>&#x201c;The court will revisit the situation of both partners in one year and reserves the right to make further adjustments in asset placement. That is all.&#x201d; <br>All? <br>I looked at Jared. <br>He shook his head and murmured, &#x201c;They let you keep the conapt.&#x201d; <br> <i>And two hundred thousand duhlars.</i> &#x201c;But&nbsp;&#x2026; she left me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No fault,&#x201d; he reminded me. <br>Three million for Leysa, when she hadn&#x2019;t spoken to me in two years. When she had only a year left at the university? When her boyfriend&#x2019;s father was the one for whom Chelesina had left me? <br>So&nbsp;&#x2026; out of some six million duhlars, I had two hundred thousand left&nbsp;&#x2026; and a small conapt in Mychela. And a consulting business that the Civil Court could suck duhlars from for another two or possibly three years? All because I went to bed with someone besides Chelesina a year after she&#x2019;d left me? <br>Jared must have been reading my mind&nbsp;&#x2026; or face, because as we turned to leave the courtroom, he said quietly, &#x201c;Equal no fault doesn&#x2019;t weigh things.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know that. I do have a problem with most of my assets going to an ungrateful daughter who won&#x2019;t speak to me even after I&#x2019;ve paid all the bills for years.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Unity policy. Permanent civil unions are supposed to protect the children. If the civil union is dissolved, the Court allocates enough assets to ensure that the child or children are adequately protected and able to continue in roughly the same lifestyle as before the dissolution.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Which punishes me for making sure she was educated and raised with all advantages,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t punish Chelesina.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t. Her design firm went bankrupt.&#x201d; <br>I had my doubts about the honesty of that bankruptcy, but Jared would just have told me what I already knew. <br>There wasn&#x2019;t a thing I could do about it. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by L.

Reprint.</p><p><p>Charlotte MacLeod (1922-2005) was an internationally bestselling author of cozy mysteries. Born in Canada, she moved to Boston as a child, and lived in New England most of her life. After graduating from college, she made a career in advertising, writing copy for the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company before moving on to Boston firm N. H. Miller &amp; Co., where she rose to the rank of vice president. In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 published her first novel, a children's book called Mystery of the White Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>Detective Inspector Madoc Rhys of the Canadian Mounties (A Pint of Murder, 1980, etc.), wife Janet, and infant daughter Dorothy are visiting Madoc's family in Wales to celebrate the 90th birthday of grandfather Sir Caradoc Rhys. A clutch of friends and relatives are in and out of the manor house, eating a succession of meals and drinking endless cups of tea. Among them is neighbor Lisa Ellis, a widow whose gem-dealer husband was murdered in Marseilles eight years before. Distant cousin Mary Rhys, a gem-cutter of unexpected affluence, and her occult-obsessed brother Bob are also guests, as is Madoc's opera-star brother Daffyd, for years in love with Lisa. It takes 150 pages of relatives, local rites, and cooing over Dorothy before Mary, long tagged the murder victim, comes to her ritualistic end. Unwinding the background to her murder, a scenario full of bizarre coincidence, is no more enthralling than what's gone before. Cloying, unconvincing, and strictly for faithful fans. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This inspirational volume offers readers daily choices by living fully in the here and now, challenging them to embrace a new way of being that integrates body, mind, and spirit.</p><p>The Osho teachings defy categorization, covering everything from the individual quest for meaning to the most urgent social and political issues facing society today. His hooks are not written but are transcribed from audio and video recordings of extemporaneous talks given in response to questions from visitors over a period of thirty-five years. Osho has been described by the Sunday Times in London as one of the "1,000 Makers of the 20th Century" and by the Sunday Mid-Day in India as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha who have changed India's India. <p>About his own work Osho has said that he is helping to create the conditions for the birth of a new kind of human being. He has often characterized this new human being as "Zorba the Buddha" capable of enjoying both the earthy pleasures of a Zorba the Greek and the silent serenity of a Gautama the Buddha. Running like a thread through all aspects of the work is a vision that encompasses both the timeless wisdom of the Last and the highest potential of Western science and technology. </p><p>Osho is also known for his revolutionary contribution to the science of inner transformation, with an approach to meditation that acknowledges the accelerated pace of contemporary life. His unique "active meditations" are designed to first release the accumulated stresses of body and mind, making it is easier to experience the thought-free and relaxed state of~ meditation.</p>Going Into Fear <p>Whenever there is fear, never try to escape from it In fact, take hints from fear. Those are the directions in which you need to travel. Fear is simply a challenge. It calls you: "Come!" </p><p>Whenever something is really good, it is also scary, because it brings you some insights. It forces you toward certain changes. It brings you to a brink from where, if you go back, you will never forgive yourself. You will always remember yourself as a coward. If you go ahead, it is dangerous. That's what is scary. Whenever there is some fear, always remember not to go back, because that is not the way to solve it. Go into it. If you are afraid of the dark night, go into the dark night because that is the only way to overcome it. That is the only way to transcend the fear. Go into the night; there is nothing more important than that. Wait, sit there alone, and let the night work. If you fear, tremble. Let the trembling be there, but tell the night, "Do whatever you want to do. I am here." After a few minutes you will see that everything has settled. The darkness is no longer dark, it has come to be luminous. You will enjoy it. You can touch it the velvety silence, the vastness, the music. You will be able to enjoy it, and you will say, "How foolish I was to be afraid of such a beautiful experience!"</p></p><h2>Scottish Myths and Legends</h2><p>Scotland draws her myths and legends from a rich and diverse legacy of powerful cultural influences. Kept alive over centuries in their ancient vernacular by an exceptionally strong oral tradition, they retain their spell-binding qualities when translated into written word. Spine-chilling tales of evil wrought by malignant supernatural beings, heart-warming stories of good deeds done by more well-meaning other-worldly creatures, gripping accounts of epic struggles and bitter conflicts from the truly heroic to the downright grisly, dark and disturbing glimpses of low cunning and treachery relieved by whimsical anecdotes full of wry humour. Brought together in this volume is a wide-ranging gallery of creatures outlandish and bizarre - from weirds and witches, monsters and mermaids, brownies and bogles to hags and hunters, kings and kelpies - whose stories will haunt and horrify, ensnare and enchant modern readers of all ages, and perhaps leave them with an uneasy sense of invisible forces at work.</p><p></p><h2>Recycled Doonesbury: Second Thoughts on a Gilded Age</h2><p><i>Recycled Doonesbury</i> allows readers to savor the uncompromising satire we have come to expect and admire from Garry Trudeau's Pulitzer Prize-winning strip.<p><i>Recycled Doonesbury</i> gives us a collection of daily and Sunday strips that underscores why <i>Doonesbury</i> is a must-read.</p><p>Trudeau's remarkable gifts of observation both delight and instruct, entertain and outrage. <i>Recycled Doonesbury</i> showcases his peerless ability to deliver provocative satire with uncanny precision.</p></p><p><i>Recycled Doonesbury</i>, subtitled <i>Second Thoughts on a Gilded Age</i> chronicles the end of the '80s, and as the decade winds down, there's a feeling that times are a changing from Malibu to Walden. Reagan gives way to Bush (though he attempts a comeback as the utterly unhinged Ron Headrest), Duke goes to work on Donald Trump's yacht, and Mike and J.J.'s marriage hits a rough spot. The strip itself rings the changes for a while, in a survey-filled parody of <i>USA Today</i>. More than 69 percent of Americans enjoyed it!<p> This volume also captures the moment when Mr. Butts springs from the tortured mind of Mike Doonesbury. Surely one of the most inspired characters ever to appear in a comic strip, Mr. Butts is a perfect example of the satirical energy that drives <i>Doonesbury</i>. This wisecracking tube of tobacco has burned his way into the collective unconscious of readers as successfully as any advertising mascot. Eat your heart out, Joe Camel.

But that suddenly changes when in the middle of the funeral, Jack&#x2019;s widow hysterically insists that he was murdered. Emma Lord, publisher of <i>The Alpine Advocate</i>, who is already investigating a threatening letter received by the town&#x2019;s beautiful blonde judge, now suspects she has two hot stories to unravel.

The years after the Civil War represented an astonishing moment of opportunity for African-Americans. The rush to build a racially democratic society from the ruins of slavery is never more evident than in the personal history of Blanche Kelso Bruce and his heirs.</p><p>Born a slave in 1841, Bruce became a local Mississippi sheriff, developed a growing Republican power base, amassed a real-estate fortune, and became the first black to serve a full Senate term. He married Josephine Willson, the daughter of a wealthy black Philadelphia doctor. Together they broke racial barriers as a socialite couple in 1880s Washington, D.C.</p><p>By befriending President Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and a cadre of liberal black and white Republicans, Bruce spent six years in the U.S. Senate, then gained appointments under four presidents (Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, and McKinley), culminating with a top Treasury post, which placed his name on all U.S. currency.</p><p>During Reconstruction, the Bruce family entertained lavishly in their two Washington town houses and acquired an 800-acre plantation, homes in four states, and a fortune that allowed their son and grandchildren to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, beginning in 1896.</p><p>The Senator's legacy would continue with his son, Roscoe, who became both a prot�g� of Booker T. Washington and a superintendent of Washington, D.C.'s segregated schools. When the family moved to New York in the 1920s and formed an alliance with John D. Rockefeller Jr., the Bruces became an enviable force in Harlem society. Their public battle to get their grandson admitted into Harvard University's segregated dormitories elicited the support of people like W. E. B. Du Bois and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and broke brave new ground for blacks of their day.</p><p>But in the end, the Bruce dynasty's wealth and stature would disappear when the Senator's grandson landed in prison following a sensational trial and his Radcliffe-educated granddaughter married a black Hollywood actor who passed for white.</p><p>By drawing on Senate records, historic documents, and the personal letters of Senator Bruce, Josephine, their colleagues, friends, children, and grandchildren, author Lawrence Otis Graham weaves a riveting social history that spans 120 years. From Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to New York, <em>The Senator and the Socialite</em> provides a fascinating look into the history of race and class in America.</p></p><p><p>The author of fourteen books, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Our Kind of People</em>, and a contributing editor for <em>Reader's Digest</em>, Lawrence Otis Graham's work has also appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Essence</em>, and <em>The Best American Essays</em>. He lives with his wife in Manhattan and Chappaqua, New York.</p>It is a revealing commentary on the history of American democracy that, of the 1,885 men and women who have served in the U.S. Senate since the founding of the republic, only five have been black. Remarkably, the first two were elected from Mississippi during the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War. Hiram Revels served for a few weeks in 1870 and then returned to relative obscurity. Blanche K. Bruce, who held his seat from 1875 to 1881, amassed a small fortune and founded what Lawrence Otis Graham calls "America's first true black dynasty."<p>In this flawed but fascinating study, Graham, a black attorney and author of Our Kind of People, a bestseller about the black upper class, tells the story of three generations of the Bruce family. It is a poignant tale of struggle, accomplishment and weakness -- and an illuminating account of American racism.</p><p>Graham's cast of characters begins with Bruce and his wife, Josephine, the senator and the socialite of the book's title. Born a slave in Virginia in 1841, the son of his owner, Bruce escaped during the Civil War, studied at Oberlin College and made his way to Mississippi, where he rose quickly in politics and purchased a plantation in 1874. His beautiful, light-skinned wife, whom he married in 1878, came from the North's tiny black upper class. After his Senate term expired, Bruce remained in Washington, D.C., where he held lucrative patronage posts, acquired a large townhouse and summer home, and presided over black high society.</p><p>The second generation of Bruces enjoyed privileged lives far removed from those of most Americans, white or black. Their only child, Roscoe, attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard, worked for a time as head of academic education at the Tuskegee Institute, then served as superintendent of black schools in Washington and manager of the Dunbar Apartments, a Harlem housing complex built by John D. Rockefeller Jr. His talented wife, Clara, attended Radcliffe and Boston University Law School, where she became the first woman anywhere to edit a law review. The third generation, also named Roscoe and Clara, followed in their parents' footsteps to Harvard and Radcliffe.</p><p>Graham does not shy away from describing the costs of these accomplishments, among them the Bruces' complete dissociation from most of black America. On the Bruce plantation in Mississippi, black sharecroppers lived in "flimsy wooden shacks" and labored in the same oppressive conditions as on white-owned estates. Equally telling, Roscoe Bruce Sr. found the exuberant mode of worship practiced by lower-class Tuskegee students "disgusting."</p><p>That Roscoe Bruce worked at Tuskegee is not coincidental, for the family shared its founder Booker T. Washington's philosophy of accommodation, as well as his reliance on connections with wealthy white patrons. Blanche Bruce said little in the Senate as white violence stripped his people of their rights. Indeed, Graham writes, the senator had "an almost single-minded obsession for maintaining favor with powerful whites." While attending Harvard, his son spied for Washington on Boston's "anti-Bookerite" black radicals. Even though he had received an elite academic education, Roscoe Bruce tried to introduce Washington's philosophy of industrial training in the District of Columbia's black schools, causing an uproar among black parents proud of their children's educational attainments. When a scandal erupted in 1919 because Bruce allowed a white man to take nude photographs of black high school students, allegedly as part of a study of physical differences between the races, he was forced to resign.</p><p>Only when it came to their own family did the Bruces turn militant. In 1923, Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell barred the college's six black freshmen, including Roscoe Jr., from living in freshman dormitories. Roscoe Sr. organized a national campaign that forced Lowell to rescind his order.</p><p>An indefatigable researcher in primary sources, Graham sometimes seems unaware of current scholarship. The opening chapters present a confusing picture of Reconstruction politics because Graham uses the word "liberal" in its modern sense of racial egalitarianism rather than its 19th-century meaning of belief in limited government and laissez-faire economics. Contrary to his account, those who called themselves liberal Republicans opposed Reconstruction.</p><p>Nonetheless, The Senator and the Socialite offers a compelling portrait of the Bruce family's rise, dynamics and downfall. In 1936, Roscoe Sr. lost his job when Rockefeller sold the Dunbar Apartments. His children lacked the drive and self-discipline of their forebears. The younger Clara failed to complete her studies at Radcliffe and eloped with a black actor. Roscoe Jr. embezzled money from an apartment complex he managed in New Jersey and then arranged a phony burglary to explain the absence of funds. He served 18 months in prison. The legal costs bankrupted the family.</p><p>Problems in the third generation of privileged families are standard grist for gossip columnists. But the black elite faced greater obstacles to recovery and had fewer resources and connections to fall back on than their white counterparts. No New York law firm would hire a black female attorney such as Clara Bruce. In their hour of need, the elite whites the Bruces had cultivated for decades abandoned them, refusing repeated requests for assistance. Roscoe Sr. and his wife were reduced to living for a time on welfare. Many of their relatives, including the younger Clara and her actor husband, avoided racism by passing for white. Today, Graham reports, most descendants of Sen. Bruce live as white persons -- an ironic but in some ways understandable end to a black dynasty to which Jim Crow America never truly offered a secure place. </p><p>Reviewed by Eric Foner <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Justification By Faith in the Second Century</h2><p>We are very familiar with the New Testament and can easily verify its teachings, but what happened to these teachings subsequently? Were they upheld, diluted or discarded? In particular, what did the Church Fathers make of Paul&#39;s cardinal doctrine &#39;justification by faith&#39;? The sixteenth-century Protestant Reformers thought it was ignored prior to Augustine (354-430). Were the writers of the second century influenced by Paul, or did they manipulate his meaning to support their own arguments and new situations? This study looks first at the New Testament to see what Paul actually says before turning to six important early Fathers: Clement of Rome at the tail end of the first century, Ignatius of Antioch, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria from the second century, and Tertullian from the late second to the early third century. &#39;I commend this booklet..[which] encourages us to see that Paul&#39;s teaching on justification by faith was present in the writings of Early Church leaders. He does not claim that it had the prominence or detailed and applied expression that it had at the Reformation: it would be unrealistic to expect that to be the case. However the evidence ...gives us a useful insight into the Early Church, and its perception and use of this key Pauline and Biblical doctrine.&#39; Peter Adam Andrew Daunton-Fear gained a love of the Early Church as a student at Cambridge.

In <i>Dataclysm</i>, Christian Rudder uses it to show us who we truly are. <br> &nbsp;<br> For centuries, we&#x2019;ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today, a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers, and without filters. Data scientists have become the new demographers.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this daring and original book, Rudder explains how Facebook "likes" can predict, with surprising accuracy, a person&#x2019;s sexual orientation and even intelligence; how attractive women receive exponentially more interview requests; and why you must have haters to be hot. He charts the rise and fall of America&#x2019;s most reviled word through Google Search and examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter. He shows how people express themselves, both privately and publicly. What is the least Asian thing you can say? Do people bathe more in Vermont or New Jersey? What do black women think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel? (Hint: they don&#x2019;t think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel.) Rudder also traces human migration over time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> Visually arresting and full of wit and insight, <i>Dataclysm</i> is a new way of seeing ourselves&#x2014;a brilliant alchemy, in which math is made human and numbers become the narrative of our time.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Christian Rudder, cofounder of OkCupid and author of <i>Dataclysm</i></b></p> <p><b>As more of our social interaction happens on social media, how much can researchers learn about us from our online interactions? </b> </p> <p>Well, they can only learn what we tell them, but in the age of Facebook and Google, that&#x2019;s become pretty much everything. To the extent that friendship, anger, sex, love, and whatever else happen online, we can investigate them. </p> <p> Your search history tells us what kind of jokes you like. Your Facebook network reveals not just your friendships, but in some cases the state of your marriage. Your preferences on OkCupid tell us what you find sexy, and your reaction to the strangers the site offers up tells us how you judge people. The articles you &#x201c;like&#x201d; tell us not just about your politics, but even predict your intelligence. </p> <p>You fold in data points like these for millions and millions of people, and you start to get a whole new picture of humankind. </p> <p><b>In Dataclysm you&#x2019;re taking this flood of information and putting it to an entirely new use: understanding human nature. So what have you found?</b> </p> <p>I tried really hard to avoid the numerical dog and pony show. There are of course lots of interesting one-off factoids, but I mostly found what I (and probably you) have always known: that people are gentle, mean, stupid, lusty, lonely, kind, foolish, shrewd, shallow, and endlessly complex. <i>Dataclysm&#x2019;s</i> central idea isn&#x2019;t necessarily what we can see using big data; it&#x2019;s the fact of the vision itself. That we can get real data on even the most private moments in people&#x2019;s lives is an astounding thing. It&#x2019;s like the second advent of reality television, but this time without the television part. Just the reality. </p> <p><b>Are you worried about any of this? </b></p> <p>I have mixed feelings about the implications. I myself almost never tweet, post, or share anything about my personal life. At the same time, I&#x2019;ve just spent three years writing about how interesting all this data is, and I cofounded OkCupid. My hope is that this ambivalence makes me a trustworthy guide through the thicket of technology and data. I admire the knowledge that social data can bring us; I also fear the consequences. </p> <p><b>You have a lot to say about race in the book, and you use data to shed light on the many ways it affects the way we interact with one another. What surprised you about your research in this area? Did you find anything unsurprising? </b> </p> <p>The data on race was surprising only in its stubborn predictability&#x2014;for all the glitzy technology, the results could&#x2019;ve been from the 1950s. I grew up in Little Rock and graduated from Central High, the first school in the South to be integrated: Eisenhower, the National Guard, mobs of white people screaming at nine black children, that&#x2019;s Central. The school embraces its history and is now over half black. I&#x2019;m no brave crusader, but race (and racism) were part of my education. So when, in researching the book, I unpacked three separate databases and found that in every one white people gave black people short-shrift, I wasn&#x2019;t shocked, you know? Asians and Latinos apply the same penalty to African Americans that white folks do, which says something about how even (relatively) recent additions to the &#x201c;American experience&#x201d; have acquired its biases. </p> <p><b>What makes this moment in time&#x2014;and this set of data&#x2014;different from the massive data surveys of the past, such as Pew, Gallup, or the Kinsey Institute? </b></p> <p>The data in my book is almost all passively observed&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no questionnaire, no contrived experiment to simulate &#x201c;real life.&#x201d; This data is real life. Online you have friends, lovers, enemies, and intense moments of truth without a thought for who&#x2019;s watching, because ostensibly no one is&#x2014;except of course the computers recording it all. This is how digital data circumvents that old research obstacle: people&#x2019;s inability to be honest when the truth makes them look bad. Digital data&#x2019;s ability to get at the private mind like this is unprecedented and very powerful. </p><b>Christian Rudder</b> is a co-founder and former president of the dating site OkCupid, where he authored the popular OkTrends blog.

He seemed to wince as the court official called out his full title in Latin. &#x2018;Imperator Caesar Publius Licinius Valerianus Augustus, <i>Pius Felix</i>, <i>Pater Patriae</i>, <i>Germanicus Maximus</i>, <i>Invictus</i>, <i>Restitutor Orbis</i>&#x2019;. At a sign, a horse was led forward. Its bridle shone with silver and gold, and its trappings were imperial purple. Needing no prompting, the elderly emperor walked to where the horse waited. As so many times before in the last few days, he got down on one knee, then the other. With a momentary pause, which might be excused in someone his age, he got down on all fours, his elbows in the dust. What seemed an age passed. The horse shifted and exhaled through its lips, the noise loud in the quiet camp. The sun was hot on the emperor&#x2019;s back. </p> <p>The sound of another man walking towards the horse broke the near-silence. Out of the corner of his eye, the emperor could see two purple boots. Deliberately, the left one was raised and placed on his neck. As many times before, its owner let some of his weight come down through the boot before he spoke. </p> <p>&#x2018;This is the truth, not what the Romans depict in their sculptures and paintings,&#x2019; he declared, then swung himself into the saddle, his weight hard upon his imperial mounting block. &#x2018;I am the Mazda-worshipping divine Shapur, King of Kings of Aryans and non-Aryans, of the race of the gods, son of the Mazda-worshipping divine Ardashir, King of Kings of the Aryans, of the race of the gods, grandson of the King Papak, of the house of Sasan; I am the lord of the Aryan nation. You mighty, look on my works and tremble.&#x2019; </p> <p>Ballista, the Roman general from beyond the borders in the far north, lay full length in the dust and watched. His reluctant <i>proskynesis</i>, or posture of adoration, was enforced by guards and the threat of a beating or worse and echoed by the rest of the Roman high command. Successianus the Praetorian Prefect, Cledonius the <i>ab Admissionibus</i>, Camillus the commander of Legio VI Gallicana &#x2013; everyone of importance who had been with the field army &#x2013; they were all there. The world had been turned upside down, the whole cosmos was shaken. For the first time, a Roman emperor had been captured by the barbarians. Ballista could feel the outrage and horror of his <i>commilitiones</i> as they were forced to witness the humiliation of Valerian &#x2013; the pious, lucky, invincible emperor of the Romans, the restorer of the world &#x2013; on his knees and dressed as a slave. </p> <p>Four days earlier, Valerian had been captured. He had been betrayed by the companion he most trusted, the <i>Comes Sacrarum Largitionum</i> Macrianus the Lame. The Count of the Sacred Largess had arranged everything. His younger son, Quietus, had led the aged emperor and his army into a trap and then abandoned them. </p> <p>Ballista, belly to the ground, furious in his abasement, thought of the repulsive youth Quietus, by now safely back in the Roman city of Samosata, and he repeated to himself a vow he had made twice before: <i>One day, maybe not soon, but one</i> <i>day, I will kill you</i>. </p> <p>Shapur caracoled his mount, its hooves plunging and stamping dangerously close to the elderly man on the ground. Then the Sassanid King of Kings paced his horse along the line of his own courtiers, noblemen and priests and rode away, laughing. </p> <p>Slowly, heavily, Valerian began to get to his feet. The butts of spears, freely wielded, encouraged the <i>Comites Augusti</i> to do the same. </p> <p>As he hauled himself up, Ballista looked at the Sassanid courtiers. There, prominent among the priests, was the Persian youth whom Ballista had known as Bagoas when the boy had been his slave. How the wheel of fortune turns. Was the youth smiling at him behind that black beard? </p> <p>The sight of Bagoas turned Ballista&#x2019;s thoughts to his <i>familia</i>. Had his ex-slaves Calgacus, Maximus and Demetrius made it to safety? Were they now also safe in Samosata? Or were they already on the road to Antioch? Antioch, where Ballista&#x2019;s two young sons and wife waited, all unaware. The pain of thinking of them was almost unbearable. Ballista spoke in his heart to the high god of his northern youth: <i>Allfather, Death-blinder, Deep Hood, Fulfiller of Desire, Woden-born as I am, hear my prayer: I will give whatever is necessary, do whatever it takes, but let me return to them &#x2013; return to them whatever the cost</i>. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>PART ONE</p> <p><i>Captivus</i></p> <p>(The East, Spring&#x2013;Summer AD260) </p> <p> </p><p>&#x2018;What is it like to lose one&#x2019;s native land? Is it a grievous loss?&#x2019;</p> <p>Euripides, <i>Phoenissae</i>, 387&#x2013;8 </p> <p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>I</p> <p>Maximus lay motionless watching the Persians. They were in front of and below him, towards the middle of the small upland meadow where three paths came together. They were not above forty paces away. He could see them clearly: in the pale moonlight, men and horses were solid, dark-grey silhouettes. There were twenty-one Sassanid cavalrymen. Maximus had counted them several times. </p> <p>The Sassanids were confident. They had dismounted and were talking quietly. They were unavoidably in the way. Maximus raised his eyes to check the position of the sickle-shaped, three-night-old moon. There was not much of the night left. With northern Mesopotamia overrun with Persian patrols, Maximus and the others had to be safe behind the walls of Zeugma by dawn. There was no time to retrace their steps or to cast about for another path which ran east&#x2013;west through the high country. If the Persians did not move on within half an hour, the Romans would have to try and fight their way through. It did not promise well. They were outnumbered three to one. Demetrius had never been much of a one in a fight, and old Calgacus was wounded. Sure, but it did not promise well at all. </p> <p>Moving slowly, hardly moving his head a fraction, Maximus looked over at Calgacus. The old Caledonian was lying on his left side, favouring his bandaged right arm. His great domed, balding skull blended well with the white rocks. Maximus was fond of Calgacus. They had been together a long time &#x2013; nineteen years, since Maximus had been bought in as a slave bodyguard to the <i>familia</i> of Ballista. Of course, Calgacus had been with Ballista since the latter&#x2019;s childhood among the Angles of Germania. Calgacus was a sound man. Maximus was fond of him, although not as fond as he would be of a good hunting dog. </p> <p>Maximus studied his companion, the dark lines of his wrinkled forehead and the black pools of his sunken cheeks. Truth be told, Maximus was worried. Sure, Calgacus was tough. But he had seemed old nearly twenty years before. Now he was wounded, and the last four days must have taken it out of the old bastard. </p> <p>Four days earlier, they had watched Ballista ride out from the trapped army, one of the five <i>comites</i> accompanying the emperor Valerian to his ill-fated meeting with the Sassanid King of Kings Shapur. They had done what their <i>patronus</i> Ballista had commanded. As the imperial party rode west, they had crossed the perimeter to the south and doubled back behind the eastern slope of the hill. The small group of horsemen &#x2013; Maximus, Calgacus and Demetrius, Ballista&#x2019;s Greek secretary, along with eight Dalmatian troopers &#x2013; had made no great distance north when they were challenged by a Sassanid picket. Maximus, the only one who could speak Persian, had shouted out the password, which Ballista had discovered from Quietus, the traitor who had led the Roman army into the trap: <i>Peroz-Shapur</i>. </p> <p>The Sassanids were suspicious. They had been told to let through only one party of Roman horsemen heading north and shouting, &#x2018;The victory of Shapur&#x2019;, and one had already passed. Yet they drew back, their dark eyes scowling, their hands on their weapons. </p> <p>Maximus and the others had ridden on. Not too fast, so as not to look as if they were fleeing; not too slowly as to appear to be flaunting themselves. Against every instinct for self-preservation, they kept to a gentle canter. </p> <p>Behind them, a lone rider, baggy clothes flapping, horse kicking up puffs of dust, had raced across the plain. He spurred up to the Persian picket. There was gesticulating, shouting. The easterners kicked their boots into the flanks of their horses. They gave tongue to a high, ululating cry. The chase was on. </p> <p>Pushing hard, Maximus and the others had galloped out of the valley of tears. They did not see Valerian, Ballista and the other <i>comites</i> hauled from their mounts and, dusty and bloodied, hustled away into captivity. They had no time to spare a glance for the remainder of the Roman field army of the east, surrounded and hopeless on the hill. They had a large party of Sassanid light cavalry only just over two bowshots behind them. They rode hard to the hills of the north-west. </p> <p>Darkness had saved them. It seemed an eon coming, then all at once it was there. A dark, dark night; the night before the new moon. Calgacus, whom Ballista had chosen to be in charge, had ordered them to double-back to the south-east. After a time, he had found a place for them to lie up. The land here was rolling hills, sometimes bunching into mountains. On the flank of one of these lay a hollow, deep and wide enough to hide eleven men and horses. There was a small stream nearby. As he rubbed down Pale Horse, the mount that Ballista had entrusted to him, Maximus approved of the Caledonian&#x2019;s choice. His hands working hard, he tried not to think about the grey gelding&#x2019;s owner; once <i>his</i> owner, now his <i>patronus</i>, the friend he had left behind. </p> <p>Maximus had been woken the following morning by the sound of goat bells. Despite the many years since he had been taken as a slave out of his native Hibernia and brought to the southlands, goat bells somehow still sounded exotic. Although alien, they were usually reassuring, speaking of a gentle, timeless Mediterranean order. That morning, they had not been. They were drawing closer. </p> <p>Looking round, Maximus saw that everyone other than old Calgacus was still asleep. The Caledonian was stretched out on the ground, peering over the lip of their hiding place. Maximus had scrambled up next to him and risked a quick look over the top. It was a small flock, no more than twenty head, strung out behind a lead animal. They were coming to the stream to drink. The purposeful tread of the leader would take them right by the hollow, would give the goatherd a perfect view of the fugitives. </p> <p>Maximus had been surprised when Calgacus gestured for him to go to the far end of the hollow. The goats were close, the tinkling of their bells loud. As Maximus moved past, two or three of the Dalmatians stirred. He motioned them to silence. In position now, he looked back at Calgacus. </p> <p>Unhurriedly, Calgacus rose to his feet and stepped up over the lip of the hollow. He stood still, hands empty by his sides.</p> <p>Pulling himself up, Maximus peeked over the top. Through the legs of the animals, he saw the goatherd. He was an elderly man with a huge beard and the air of a patriarch. He was leaning on a staff, calmly regarding Calgacus. The goatherd&#x2019;s untroubled manner suggested that ugly old Caledonians or even daemons popped up out of every other gully he passed. </p> <p>&#x2018;Good day, grandfather,&#x2019; said Calgacus.</p> <p>For a time the goatherd did not respond. Maximus had begun to wonder if he did not speak Greek. He was wearing baggy eastern-style trousers, but then, everyone in Mesopotamia did. </p> <p>&#x2018;Good day, my child,&#x2019; the local replied at last. Maximus felt an urge to laugh building inside him.</p> <p>&#x2018;Is it safe to be out with the goats with the Sassanids all around?&#x2019;</p> <p>The goatherd considered Calgacus&#x2019;s question, weighing it up. &#x2018;I keep to the higher hills. The goats must drink. If the Persians see me, they may not kill me. What can you do?&#x2019; </p> <p>The local had his back almost completely to Maximus. Now the latter saw the point of Calgacus&#x2019;s silent instruction. Quietly, he stood. As Calgacus glanced over, he touched the hilt of his sword. There was a pause before the Caledonian gave a tiny shake of his head. </p> <p>&#x2018;May the gods hold their hands over you, grandfather,&#x2019; said Calgacus.</p> <p>With due deliberation, the goatherd turned his patriarchal gaze first on Maximus then back to Calgacus. &#x2018;I think they may do already.&#x2019; </p> <p>The staff tapped the lead goat on the rump. The herder turned to go. Above the swelling tinkle of bells, he called back, &#x2018;May the gods hold their hands over you, my children.&#x2019; </p> <p>Maximus stepped over to Calgacus. &#x2018;If they catch him, the reptiles will torture him. Not many men could keep a secret under that.&#x2019; </p> <p>The old Caledonian shrugged. &#x2018;What can you do?&#x2019;</p> <p>Maximus laughed. &#x2018;How true, <i>my child</i>, how true.&#x2019; </p> <p>&#x2018;Shut the fuck up, and take the next watch,&#x2019; replied Calgacus aff ably.</p> <p>They had saddled up at dusk. With the true night came thousands of stars and the thinnest of thin new moons. According to the ways of his people, Maximus made a wish on the new moon, a wish he could never divulge, for certain to do so would spoil its purpose. </p> <p>Calgacus had led them to the north-west. With two riders out in front, they took it easy. There could not be many miles to the Euphrates. Unless the Sassanids intervened, they would be in Samosata well before dawn. </p> <p>They had been travelling for some hours, their hopes rising, when, as the malignant gods willed it, the intervention came. A Persian challenge, loud in the night. A cry of alarm, then further shouts in an eastern-sounding language. Calgacus circled his arm, wheeling the tiny column; everyone booted their horses. All around was the rattle of hooves, the ringing of equipment and, from behind, the roar of pursuit. </p> <p>Maximus had sensed as much as seen the solid black line of an arrow as it shot past him, accelerating ahead into the night. A second later, he had heard the <i>wisp</i> of an arrow&#x2019;s passing. Momentarily, he wondered if it was another unseen arrow or the sound of the first. Shrugging this germ of a huge idea out of his mind, he slung his shield over his back. As he rode, it banged painfully into his neck and back. At this short range, an arrow would probably punch clean through its linden boards, but somehow its weight and discomfort made him feel a little better. </p> <p>They galloped on, over the pale, rolling hills, round dark, up-thrust mountains, past gloomy vineyards and orchards, through burnt hamlets and by abandoned farms. They crashed through small, upland streams; their beds stony, the water no more than hoof-high. </p> <p>It is hard to outride men in fear for their ...</p></p><h2>Ships of the American Revolution and Their Models</h2><p>Detailed information for the model builder.

Having grown up in Seattle, she was sure there was no place greener than Washington State, but that picture proved her wrong. Twenty-five years later, she went to Dingle and was seduced by the intense emerald green of the countryside, the colorful terraced houses, the sparkling blue of the sea, and the friendly, charismatic people. A year after returning home to America, she decided to make the move to Ireland to pursue a master's degree in journalism at the National University of Ireland, Galway. While she was there, she met her future husband, Richard, in a tae kwon do class.<br><br>After receiving her degree, Christina married Richard and stayed in Ireland for a few years before moving to London, where she currently lives. Since then, she has enjoyed writing for print, radio, and online media in Ireland, England, and the United States, including Dublin's <i>Sunday Times,</i> Galway's <i>Connacht Tribune,</i> the <i>Galway Independent,</i> the <i>Seattle Post Intelligencer, Colures Magazine,</i> Expedia.com, and USAToday.com.<br><br>When not busy writing, Christina likes to spend time with friends and family, read, work out at the gym, and travel with her husband and their young son, Adam.<br><b>Living Abroad in Ireland with Christina McDonald</b><br><b>1. What are a few things that draw people to move to Ireland?</b><br>I think a lot of people have at least a little Irish in them, and this makes us feel like we are all cousins of a sort. In fact, the Irish often joke about people coming over in search of their great, great, great aunt&#x2019;s cousin, twice removed.&#x201d; But it&#x2019;s this link to Ireland however tenuous that people love. There is also a little bit of the romanticized Ireland that people are drawn to: leprechauns, fairies, four-leaf clovers, etc. This mythical idea of Ireland draws a lot of people. St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day is huge, too, in North America particularly; it&#x2019;s a holiday when people can let go, drink a few pints, and have the <i>craic</i> (good times) with good friends, and it makes us all feel just a little Irish inside.<br><br><b>2. What do you consider to be essential items to pack before moving to Ireland? Are there any things you just can&#x2019;t find there?</b><br>Jif peanut butter and Kraft macaroni and cheese. It&#x2019;s such a staple in many Americans&#x2019; cupboards, but they don&#x2019;t have it over there. Sometimes when you&#x2019;re away from home and you&#x2019;re feeling a little homesick, you just want the basics from your childhood. Other than food products, though, you really don&#x2019;t have to bring much more than your personals. Ireland is on a completely different electrical system, so don&#x2019;t even bother bringing anything that plugs in. Anything else you need, you can easily find.<br><br><b>3. Where is the best St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day parade?</b><br>Last year there were more than 100 St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day parades across Ireland, but the biggest and best is definitely Dublin&#x2019;s. About 550,000 spectators attended their parade last year. The Dublin St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day parade began in 1996, and is the main reason that St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day is so hugely celebrated throughout the world. It is truly an international festival, of which the Irish are very proud. It celebrates the talents and achievements of Irish people of every age and social background, and is a day that everyone around the world wants to be Irish. Dublin&#x2019;s streets are jammed from early morning until late at night every day of the three-day festival, which offers a fair, music, <i>c�il�&#x2019;s</i> (traditional Irish dancing), and culminates in the St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day parade.<br><br><b>4. What are some of your favorite things to eat that are unique to Ireland?</b><br>While you can get Irish stew just about anywhere, it never tastes as good as when you get it in a dark, cozy pub with a pint of Guinness in Ireland. Tayto crisps (chips) are like potato chips, but better somehow. Barry&#x2019;s Tea, made in Cork, is my staple. Wherever I go in the world I always make sure to have my Barry&#x2019;s Tea.<br><br><b>5. How does the cost of living compare to North America?</b><br>Ireland can be quite an expensive country compared to North America, but on the flip side, you do get subsidized healthcare and reasonable public transportation, which saves you money. If you live in a city or town center you will never have to buy a car, as walking or taking buses is easier (and cheaper). Going out to eat or going out for drinks can be quite expensive, but if you shop carefully you can generally get a lot of groceries for relatively little money. However, this all depends on where you are from. If you are coming over from New York, the cost will be a bit more comparable, but if you&#x2019;re coming over from a tiny little town in Ohio, you should have a good chunk of money saved. Of course, prices in Ireland have started to drop some since the recession hit, so it is more affordable today than it was five years ago.<br><br><b>6. Where did you spend the most time when you first arrived? Where do you go now that you know the country better?</b><br>When I first arrived, I stayed in Dublin. I think it&#x2019;s the best place to base yourself. Everywhere in the Republic is less than three to four hours from Dublin by train, so it&#x2019;s very conveniently located. If you&#x2019;re in the city center, you don&#x2019;t even need to rent a car; while Dublin is a city, it isn&#x2019;t massive, so you can walk most of it in a day. Alternatively, there are also easy public transport options for getting around. Now that I know Ireland better, I go to either Galway or Dublin. I just love Dublin, and it&#x2019;s where a lot of my friends are; on the other hand, I went to college in Galway, and the bohemian, laid-back attitude of the city really draws me. It&#x2019;s perched right on Galway Bay, and is just a beautiful town. You couldn&#x2019;t find a city that better represents Ireland so authentically.<br><br><b>7. Are there any significant cultural differences people should be aware of when moving to Ireland?</b><br>Not really. The Irish are a fairly laid-back bunch. Make sure to use your knife and fork (rather than just your fork) while eating, and don&#x2019;t talk too loud. The Irish don&#x2019;t like loud, abrasive people, despite their penchant for being loud after a few pints. And if you get teased, don&#x2019;t take it too personally just laugh along.<br><br><b>8. What do you love most about life in Ireland?</b><br>I love the laid-back attitude and the ability to just be myself and feel accepted. I like the sarcastic sense of humor and the ability to laugh just about anything off. I felt like people in America took things quite seriously. The Irish are on the opposite end of the spectrum: they don&#x2019;t take things seriously at all. Even now, when their country is in a deep recession, they still go to the pub and laugh it off and know that, eventually, things will come back around. I love that sense of optimism. And I love the sense of family and community that everybody has.<br><br><b>9. Should someone moving to Ireland find housing before they leave or look upon arrival?</b><br>I would suggest researching the area you want to live in and having a general idea about the location you are interested in whether it caters to young professionals, families, retired people, etc. But don&#x2019;t sign any leases or pay any deposits until after you have arrived and had a chance to visually inspect the place. You can get short-term accommodation in B&amp;B&#x2019;s or vacation rental homes while you look for more permanent accommodation.<br><br><b>10. What would people be surprised to know about life in Ireland?</b><br>I think a lot of people have this romantic idea of a cottage in the country and life being grand and leprechauns dancing with a pot of gold. Life in Ireland is still life. You still have to pay your bills, go grocery shopping, put gas in the car, all the normal things. Ireland is stunningly beautiful and you can have a lot of fun, but you should definitely go for a vacation before just up and moving there. Otherwise, you might be surprised when you get to Ireland and you&#x2019;re surrounded by constant rain, poor public transportation out in the villages, blaring traffic in the cities, and isolation if you live in your cottage in the country. Be realistic and find out what you want before you go.<br></p><h2>And All Between</h2><p>Eight-year-old Terra escapes from the darkness and hunger of her Erdling world beneath the roots and joins three Kindar youngsters of the trees in a dangerous undertaking to bring the two peoples together</p><p>The recipient of three Newberry Honor Book awards for <i>The Egypt Game</i>, <i>The Headless Cupid</i>, and <i>The Witches of Worm</i>, Zilpha Keatley Snyder&#x2019;s first book was published in 1964.

Most histories of this famous Civil War siege have been written by the victors; this one presents a day-by-day account from the Confederate vantage point. Indeed, these long-dead men come to life as we read their experiences and perceptions told in their own voices, which ring clear and without apology.<br><br>In 1862 the Dixie Rebels of DeSoto Parish left for New Orleans. They and other Louisianians were formed into regiments and dispatched for Vicksburg. In the year that followed, the troops witnessed the shelling of Vicksburg by Union gunboats, the outbreak of disease, the lonely heroics of the Confederate ironclad <i>Arkansas</i><i>,</i> the daily drudgery of camp life, and Jeff Davis&#x2019;s visit to the beleaguered city.<br><br>With immediacy and in intriguing detail several correspondents describe daily life in the trenches from their individual perspectives during each of the forty-seven days of the siege. Yet their stories do not end with the capitulation of the city, but continue in an epilogue as the troops return home and then continue their service for the balance of the war. Their experiences transcended their own worlds. These young men of Louisiana still have something important to tell us.</p><p>Allan C.

In doing so they are providing significant materials which will be of great interest to Civil War scholars. . . . a real contribution to our knowledge of the American Civil War, particularly in reference to the Vicksburg campaign. I have no doubt that it will be quoted from and cited repeatedly by scholars attempting to provide an overall view or synthesis of this extremely important campaign.

There is also an introduction which addresses the development of Matisse&#39;s aesthetic values and artistic theories.</p><p>"This book is utterly indispensable to an understanding of Matisse, and therefore of early modernism as well. The original edition transformed Matisse studies by making broadly accessible as never before this great artist's writings, interviews, and other statements on the purposes of his work. This new, revised edition, with its additional texts, sharpened translations, and new annotations, will prove even more essential&#x2014;as both a work of reference and as an engrossing, highly accessible introduction to the depth and diversity of Matisse's thought." &#x2014;John Elderfield, Chief Curator at Large, The Museum of Modern Art, New York<br><br> "Flam has edited Matisse . . . with close translation (thank God), admirable editorial introductions, and detailed notes to the forty-four brief pieces from forty-seven years." &#x2014;Robert Motherwell, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "The publication of this anthology of forty-four of Matisse's 'writings' on art is long overdue and should prove to be an extremely useful and popular addition to the growing documentary literature of twentieth-century art." &#x2014;John Hallmark Neff, <i>Burlington Magazine</i>This book retains a favored place among my own works, not only because it was the first book I Published, but also because it has been especially meaningful and useful to artist. Because Matisse was so undogmatic in his wisdom he speaks persuasively to artist working in many different ways and in many different mediums. In fact, I think that for Matisse the ideal audience for his writings was one composed mainly of artist and students.</p><h2>Ordinary Grace: An Examination of the Roots of Compassion, Altruism, and Empathy, and the Ordinary Individuals Who Help Others in Extraordinary Ways</h2><p>A psychotherapist explores the origins of compassion, grace, and altruism through studies of religion and science, showing the deep motivations of selfless behaviors and demonstrating how the good can cast out the bad. 12,000 first printing.</p><p>Kathleen Brehony, a Jungian clinical psychiatrist, refuses to believe that acts of kindness are exceptional or even random.

She takes us into the homes of everyday heroes, such as a New Jersey couple who adopted four HIV-infected children from a Romanian orphanage. We enter inner-city neighborhoods and small-town high schools and find out that the plight of today's youth is not all doom and gloom, as the media would suggest. In fact, many teens are spiritually thriving as a result of their own acts of kindness--the tutoring they offer younger children or the food they deliver to their elders.<p> If you're looking for an antedote to the daily barrage of cynical and pessimistic claims about human nature, this will do the trick. There's even a chapter devoted to showing readers how to create more grace in everyday life. Through strong storytelling supported by extensive research, Brehony makes a convincing case for the inborn and sacred goodness of humanity. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>A heartening inquiry into why ordinary folks routinely go the second mile for others, by clinical psychologist Brehony (Awakening at Midlife: Realizing Your Potential for Growth and Change, 1996). What causes altruism in some people? Is it nature or nurture? The author makes a strong case for nature here, drawing from research on newborns and primates to argue for an innate, biologically based compassion. Such instincts are either reinforced or quelled by life experiences, though Brehony says that in some people, even truly horrifying childhood traumas only intensify the impulse to be kind to others. The quiet strength of this book lies in its storytelling, as Brehony draws upon field research, follows up on media stories, or even employs members of her own family to demonstrate that people can and do carry out tremendously empathic actions every day. We meet a New Jersey couple who have adopted four HIV-positive Romanian orphans, and a doctor who sacrifices all of his free time to procuring computers so that terminally ill children can communicate with one another in cyberspace. Brehony devotes a whole chapter to organ donation, describing incidents with both deceased and living donors (in two instances, people felt moved to donate a kidney to a casual friend). Another chapter explores how a couple who lost their child to a degenerative illness raised tens of thousands of dollars to design and build a ``wheelchair-friendly'' playground where all kids can play together, regardless of physical ability. Brehony writes that those who exhibit this kind of ``ordinary grace'' classically show an optimism about the fundamental goodness of humanity (``Anyone would do what I did''), as well as a conviction that they are the ones who have been blessed by the giving. A restorative tonic, more than mere chicken soup for the soulbecause it may well inspire readers to go out and do something good for somebody. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There, far from prying eyes, the government stores former intelligence employees whose psychiatric states make them a danger to their own government, people whose ramblings might endanger ongoing operations or prove dangerously inconvenient. One of these employees, former Consular Operations agent Hal Ambler, is kept heavily medicated and closely watched. But there's one difference between Hal and the other patients - Hal isn't crazy. With the help of a sympathetic nurse, Hal manages to clear his mind of the drug-induced haze and then pulls off a daring escape. Now he's out to discover who stashed him here and why - but the world he returns to isn't the one he remembers. Friends and longtime associates don't remember him, there are no official records of Hal Ambler, and, when he first sees himself in the mirror, the face that looks back at him is not the one he knows as his own.<br></p><p><p><b>HE'S SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST&#x2015;HIMSELF.</b></p><p>On Parrish Island, off the coast of Virginia, lies a psychiatric facility.

But Lt Colonel Alan Warren was sent there in early 1941 to take charge of all SOE operations in the Far East. His job was far from easy as both the native population and the military saw little purpose in his mission. Yet a year later Britain&#39;s empire in the Far East had collapsed like a pack of cards, suffering disaster at sea and on land. This is the story of that year for the Orient Mission (the name given to this section of SOE) as this small number of men tried desperately to achieve results against the Japanese advance through Asia. In the summer of 1941 a training school was set up near headquarters under Major Jim Gavin to instruct in guerilla warfare behind enemy lines. After being joined by the famous Freddie Spencer Chapman and Jack Knott, the team trained communist guerrillas, European stay behind parties, the Hong Kong Recce Regiment and the Burma Levies. The latter were volunteers who went on fighting long after the regular armies were in retreat. As the Japanese invaded Malaya, Siam, Hong Kong, Johore and Burma, stay behind parties took to the jungle to organise subversive activities; some died, many became prisoners and some survived after perilous journeys to safety. After exhaustive research, Richard Gough has written the full story of the Orient Mission and of the colourful characters who ran it, telling of what they tried to achieve and the results of their endeavours in the face of tremendous odds.</p><p></p><h2>Contemporary Psychodynamic Theory and Practice: Toward a Critical Pluralism</h2><p>Contemporary Psychodynamic Theory and Practice introduces the contributions of the key thinkers in the broader psychodynamic tradition, demonstrating the relevance of relational perspectives and recent developments for psychotherapy and psychosocial intervention. William Borden presents the developmental perspectives and clinical approaches of divergent theorists, from Freud, Jung, and Adler to Winnicott and Kohut, and shows how their views enlarge understanding of essential concerns in clinical practice. Practitioners and policy makers alike can benefit from its insights.</p><p>William Borden (MA, PhD, University of Chicago) is senior lecturer in the School of Social Service Administration and lecturer in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Chicago, where he teaches courses on contemporary psychodynamic theory, human development, and comparative psychotherapy. He has published extensively on relational perspectives in contemporary psychoanalysis, integrative models of psychotherapy and narrative psychology, and empirical research on stress, coping, and development across the life course. He has worked as a psychotherapist, supervisor, and consultant in mental health clinics and community agencies since 1983. He is a member of the American Psychological Association, Division of Psychoanalysis; the Chicago Association for Psychoanalytic Psychology; the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration; and the National Association of Social Workers.Dr. Borden makes an excellent case for how social work has always had a broad framework that makes it an appropriate discipline to integrate the relational perspectives of psychodynamic theory. Borden does not advocate one unifying theory, in fact, he advocates for critical pluralism as an essential framework for our times. --Terry Northcut, Director of the Doctoral Program at Loyola University Chicago; --Terry Northcut, Loyola University, Chicago<br><br>Freud is here. So are Jung, Adler, Winnicott, Kohut, Rank, Ferenczi, Suttie, Melanie Klein, Fairbairn, Bowlby, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Horney. Bordon (psychiatry, U. of Chicago) makes good use of these key thinkers within the psychodynamic tradition, explaining concepts and theories and applying them to clinical perspectives, clinical applications and contexts. With a comparative framework for clinical practice firmly in mind, he includes recent developments for psychotherapy and psychosocial intervention as he identifies psychoanalysis as an evolving field, including material on the emergence of the relational paradigm and relational theory and integrative perspectives in clinical practice. The result is a remarkably compact but accessible treatment of the great thinkers, great ideas, and great applications to real life. --Jim Clark, University of Kentucky<br><br>This is a splendid book. Borden has provided an excellent, readable, and incisive review of psychoanalytic perspective from Freud's initial statement to present time. Well presented yet scholarly, this is an ideal text for students and others interested in the wide scope of psychoanalysis. --Bertram Cohler, University of Chicago</p><h2>Northern Lights: The Age of Scottish Lighthouses</h2><p>In much of the Western world, wherever there are seacoasts, lighthouses exert a perennial fascination for people - in spite of the fact that modern technology has taken away the human element in operating them.</p><p>Dr Alison Morrison-Low is Principal Curator, History of Scientific Instruments and Photograph, Department of Science and technology, National Museums Scotland."... a comprehensive and wonderfully eclectic review of Scotland's lighthouses.

" Scottish Life Magazine<br></p><h2>Queen Anne</h2><p>The reign of Queen Anne, the last Stuart monarch, was a period of significant progress for the country: Britain became a major military power on land, the union of England and Scotland created a united kingdom of Great Britain, and the economic and political basis for the Golden Age of the eighteenth century was established. However, the queen herself never received credit for these achievements and has long been depicted as a weak and ineffectual monarch dominated by her advisers.

It&#x2019;s a tale of success--and excess: great music, drugs (he overdosed and was pronounced dead three times), and resurrection.</p> <p>The Dead Boys, with roots in the band Rocket from the Tombs, came out of Cleveland to dominate the NYC punk scene in the mid-1970s. Their hit &#x201c;Sonic Reducer&#x201d; soon became a punk anthem. Now, for the first time, Cheetah dishes on the people he&#x2019;s known onstage and off, including the Dead Boys&#x2019; legendary singer Stiv Bators, Johnny Thunders of the New York Dolls, the Ramones, the Clash, Pere Ubu, and the Ghetto Dogs, as well as life at CBGBs, a year with Nico, and more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> Straight from the man, these are the backstage stories that every punk fan will want to hear. Never mind the Sex Pistols, here&#x2019;s Cheetah Chrome!</p><p><p>Cheetah Chrome has played guitar for bands including the Dead Boys and Rocket from the Tombs, co-wrote punk classics like &#x201c;Sonic Reducer&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t It Fun,&#x201d; and was declared one of <i>Musician Magazine</i>&#x2019;s Top 100 Guitarists of all Time.

They had the chops, but never really got the respect or credit they deserved for their role serving on the front lines of the New York punk scene in the late 70&#x2019;s...[In Cheetah Chrome] The Dead Boys are finally getting some of the credit they deserve.&#x201d; - <b>Examiner.com, September 30, 2010</b>&nbsp;From the day I received this book every open opportunity I had, I buried my face in its pages! This book combines some of my favorite things in books, autobiographies, punk rock, and graphic detail of life wrecking adventures. The book starts with an endearing forward written by Legs McNeil leading to Cheetah Chrome&#x2019;s brutally honest assessment of his life and it&#x2019;s affects on others. Like many people in the world of punk rock, I look at the name Cheetah Chrome as a piece of MY history. His name ranks up there with the immortals of punk rock such as The Ramones (All of them), Iggy Pop, Sid Vicious, Johnny Rotten, Johnny Thunders, Stiv Bator, etc... This book not only mentions those legends of punk, but also great personal stories and interactions Cheetah had with each. When the clich�, sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll I normally roll my eyes and groan. However, in this situation that is truly the only way to label Cheetah Chromes life, but particularly in that order. Cheetah has lived a life that many have tried, but not many have succeeded to live as long as he has. Never in a book have I felt so connected to a character, let alone a true to life person who wrote an autobiography! I would recommend this book to not only the Punk Rock historians &amp; punk rock enthusiasts, but to anyone who roots for the underdog. - <b>Punk Rock Review, September 21, 2010</b><p></p></p><h2>Loons: Song of the Wild</h2><p>A first-of-its-kind anthology bringing together the best writing and photography available on loons.

The Vision of God is known as a classic of Christian mysticism, putting many believers in touch with the divine.<p>Many Christians have a desire to experience God, rather than just believe in Him. Nicholas of Cusa provides an excellent guidebook for Christians who sense something deeper to the Christian experience. He was a mystic. He experienced God on a number of levels and taught people to move beyond mere belief and have similar experiences.</p><p>By bringing spiritual principles into the Christian religious setting, Nicholas was able to instruct and enrich thousands of people. This he did at a time when Christianity was beginning to cast a long shadow of strict dogma over the masses -- it was the dawning of the Inquisition -- yet Nicholas was able to keep his mystical teachings Safely within the boundaries of the Church.</p><p>During this incredibly busy and volatile time, Nicholas engaged himself whenever he could in meditation and study. It is from these introspective journeys that he received his spiritual insights. He also spent much time with a group of Benedictine monks, who asked for spiritual guidance from Nicholas after recognizing his gifts. Nicholas responded with The Vision of God in December of 1453.

Is there a place where you might draw the line and simply have to say no? Eight women. Four decades of friendship. One unimaginable request. Where can you find a story about friendship, laughter and the good things in life that also touches on alcoholism, infidelity, porn addiction, illness and grief? For many women, it's often within their own circle of friends. Whether your BFFs are in their twenties or are seniors, everyone has a story. The Bridge Club reminds us of the complexities of women&#x2019;s friendships through an entertaining and often moving tale of eight women whose lives intersect once a month initially to play the game of bridge. What began as one night turns into four decades that span the segments of a woman's journey from youthful optimism to embracing the challenges and opportunities presented in life's later years. Based loosely on the author&#x2019;s own bridge club, the story weaves the reader through a maze of life's inevitable scenarios. This is a novel for anyone who values friendship. Not simply the "Hi, how are you?" type of friendship but rather the kind that weathers all sorts of storms, unselfishly celebrates triumphs, and hums along year after year with never an unkind word. It does exist. If you have such a friendship in your life you will relate to the women in The Bridge Club. If you don't, perhaps the story will inspire you to search for it. Throughout the story each of the characters faces challenges and change in her life. The Bridge Club emphasizes how honest and loyal friendship helped to enable these changes and how these women empowered and learned from each other in the process. Through laughter, tears, and everything in between the story meets life head on and affirms that building a strong foundation of friendship is a priceless asset.</p><p>The aftermath of writing my debut novel has been an incredible journey.

Medieval magicians practiced magic to harness the demons who were believed to have constructed the Temple, and mystics of all faiths had visions of a celestial Temple, mirroring that on earth, where divine secrets would be revealed.<br><br><i>Solomon's Temple</i> draws on holy texts and mystic writings, works of art and architecture, modern reconstructions, and photographs to reveal the myriad ways in which the Temple and the sacred ground on which it stood have inspired mankind through the ages. 200 illustrations, 130 in color.</p><p><b>William Hamblin</b> is Associate Professor of History at Brigham Young University.

And yet time is the same every time. Sixty seconds in every minute, 60 minutes in every hour, and so on. That means that after 30 minutes, you've burned 1,800 seconds, whether you were standing in line to get a driver's license photo or watching your favorite TV comedy. The only difference is how each of those 1,800 seconds felt as it ticked away.<br><br>In other words, how you fill the time ultimately determines what you get out of it.<br><br>If you happen to be on the phone with a friend you haven't spoken with in a year, you won't even realize there's a wait for that driver's license photo. Meanwhile, if that episode of your favorite show is a rerun, your mind may wander and time will pass more slowly.<br><br>Time is like that for just about every activity, but nothing gives people more fits than time partnered with exercise. Consider:<br><br>� What's the most common thing you hear about exercise? "I don't have time."<br><br>�&nbsp;Packing a bag, driving to the gym, changing, working out, cooling down, showering (hopefully!), changing again, and returning to your day-- all represent little pockets of time. They add up.<br><br>�&nbsp;What about those seconds ticking away during a workout? Well, let's just say that some seconds tick faster than others. (I can vouch for that: Mile 2 of a marathon ticks away a lot faster than, say, Mile 22.)<br><br>�&nbsp;And then there's the biggest issue of all, the problem this book was designed to solve: How much time do you really need to exercise effectively?<br><br>The answer? Well, I'm not sure a definitive answer exists. The science is pretty clear in that the health benefits level off at around 150 minutes per week of moderate activity, which equates to 30 minutes of brisk walking 5 days a week. That's a solid recommendation, and it makes 30 minutes one kind of sweet spot. But is it definitive? Nope. Someone who wants to run a marathon needs more exercise than someone who just wants to enjoy a Spinning class with friends. Still, if you want to feel better, improve your health, build strength, and live a more active lifestyle, you need very little time to exercise. In fact, it comes down to the title of this chapter: To get real benefits from exercise, it's not about time. It's about what you put into the time you have--the types of exercises and the intensity with which you perform them. Once you master that concept, the clock becomes a very good friend indeed.<br><br>Know Before You Go (This Is Important!)<br><br>I recommend that anyone who wants to ramp up his or her exercise activity see a doctor for a full physical beforehand. This is especially true for anyone who has been inactive for a while or is over age 40 (or both). Let the doc know what you have planned and that you want to know that the machine is in good working order before you start. This isn't a disclaimer-- this is smart medical advice for several reasons.<br><br>�&nbsp;Your doctor can give you a thorough going-over, including examining your medical history. This is especially crucial if you've had past physical issues like chest pain, dizziness, or even joint pain.<br><br>�&nbsp;Your doctor can help guide your fitness plan. She's probably not a trainer, but she can give you advice on how hard you should go based on your physical condition. And listen to her. One thing about gung-ho humans: Their eyes are bigger than their stomachs (and muscles and cardiovascular fitness level).<br><br>�&nbsp;You'll establish baseline numbers for your blood pressure, cholesterol, and all those other wonderful markers you should have memorized but probably don't. Improving your fitness generally improves your health stats. Don't you want to know how well you're doing? That's part of the payoff!<br><br>INTENSITY, EFFICIENCY, TOTALITY<br><br>This book promises 30-minute workouts--and you'll find a bunch of them in here--but the fact is, you can do the 10- and 20-minute versions and still enjoy health benefits, build muscle, and increase your overall fitness. How? Again, it's about intensity and volume--how hard you work and how much work you do in a given time period.<br><br>I'm a big endurance sports guy. I run marathons and do Ironman triathlons. Those are timed events, which means that the better I perform in a race, the shorter that race is for me. (Now there's some incentive to swim, run, and pedal faster--it'll all be over sooner.) But if you have a set time for a workout, it's kind of like an empty box on moving day. You could toss a bunch of stuff into it and put it on the truck, but then you'd probably need more empty boxes to get the end result you want, which is all your stuff on the truck.<br><br>But what if you learned how to pack the box more efficiently? To use all the space in the box? And do it in half the time? You'd get all your stuff on the truck in one shot and boom, you'd be done.<br><br>That's what this book will help you do. How? By focusing on intensity, efficiency, and totality.<br><br>�&nbsp;Intensity. The workouts in this book (whether 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or 30 minutes) consist of high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. You may have heard of HIIT. We'll discuss it in more detail shortly, but the bottom line is that HIIT workouts deliver incredible performance results--you'll be better, stronger, and faster, for sure--but also serious, research-backed health benefits. The ever-expanding science of HIIT shows that you can achieve better physical, mental, and physiological results if you're able to master this type of workout. (I think it's worth it!)<br><br>�&nbsp;Efficiency. Most of the exercises in the 30-minute workouts are designed to work multiple muscles across a series of com�d movements. A single-movement exercise like a biceps curl is just fine for your biceps, but not very efficient for the rest of your body. If you can engage dozens of muscles in 5 seconds versus just a few muscles, which strategy gets more done? Using the moving box analogy, these exercises pack more activity and muscle engagement into a smaller space (or time, as it were).<br><br>�&nbsp;Totality. I'm all about total-body fitness. Yes, I offer some targeted workouts for your core, lower body, and upper body later in the book, but the overall mission is building your entire body in a balanced way to help it perform better and prevent injury. Oh, and your day-to-day life will be easier--from climbing stairs to hauling laundry. Total-body fitness leads to total-life payoffs.<br><br>Why I Believe Exercising 7 Days a Week Is an Awesome Idea<br><br>Exercising 7 days a week sounds extreme, but it really isn't. Some people out there would immediately say, "No way--your body needs time to recover. Why would a doctor recommend something so crazy?"<br><br>It's pretty simple: I believe the human body is designed for everyday use. We're mobile creatures. Sofas are a relatively new invention. Just look back a hundred years, five hundred, a thousand, and more. Our ancestors, from the caves to the farm fields, got their butts out the door early and sweated all day, every day. The difference is they did it because they had to, without any real knowledge of how to take care of themselves and with very little medical care. Well, we can do it because we want to, it's good for us, and we know so much more today (and if you do injure yourself, you probably won't die like in the old days).<br><br>The key to daily exercise? Avoiding overuse. How do you do this?<br><br>Change it up. Do something different from your normal workouts, and go easier than you normally do. Bring friends. Smile a lot. I call this kind of movement dynamic rest and talk about it in more detail later in the book- -with suggestions!<br><br>I look at daily exercise as a healthy addiction. We have such an obesity problem and so many obesity-related health issues that are treated after they happen, as opposed to trying to prevent them in the first place. Hypertension and diabetes are preventable and potentially reversible with daily exercise. Exercise is medicine, preventive medicine, and I believe it should be a daily ritual just like brushing your teeth.<br><br>My point is, a body that is used sensibly every day grows accustomed to being used and won't be as prone to injury.<br><br>SCORE YOUR FIRST BIG HIIT (OR, HOW MANY PLAYS ON THE TERM HIIT CAN WE FIT INTO ONE BOOK?)<br><br>Interval training isn't new. Runners have a classic German term for it-- fartlek--which has inspired jokes among high school cross-country teammates for decades. People who use intervals in any kind of training know how well they work.<br><br>So what is HIIT? It's simple: Instead of exercising at one pace for an extended period of time--think jogging 3 miles on a Saturday morning--you work at a higher intensity for short intervals of time (thus the name) with rest periods figured in. So a runner, for example, would run at a much faster pace for, say, 30 seconds, then dial it back for a minute, and then ramp back up for 30 seconds more, etc. That's a very basic example; there are limitless ways you can break up intervals and rest periods, and you can apply the concept to any activity (even bowling, though that would be . . . strange).<br><br>Steady-state cardio exercises like running are good for you--fantastic, even--and do challenge your body. However, over long periods, they ultimately train your physique to be more efficient. Think how elite distance runners have more compact frames--their bodies have been trained to use energy more efficiently; therefore, their muscles have adapted to be smaller to consume fewer resources for the effort exerted.<br><br>Now consider the sprinter: bigger muscles, more explosive fast-twitch fibers, built not for long-haul efficiency but for short-burst intensity. Sprinters by default use interval training because they need that all-out, leave-nothing-in-the-tank effort to get to the finish line first.<br><br>That's HIIT in a nutshell. But what does it do for you? And how does it do it?<br><br>Working at the high-intensity level raises your heart rate and increases your body's oxygen consumption. This can lead to burning more calories and fat. In fact, your body continues consuming oxygen after the workout is over, sometimes for hours. This is known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, or EPOC. I use this concept all the time in my office. I talk to my patients about turning on their "metabolic furnace" for the day by using intensity first thing in the morning. Exactly how many more calories are burned? It's difficult to calculate--every person's body is different-- but it can be as high as 25 to 30 percent more, compared with steady-state workouts, according to the American College of Sports Medicine.<br><br>So: shorter workouts, higher oxygen and calorie burn, better total-body fitness. Not a bad collection of benefits. But like a bad infomercial-- wait! There's more!<br><br>HIIT has been around long enough that researchers have had time to study its various effects on the body, and I expect more research to pile up as the years go by, since HIIT is a rich subject. Aside from considering all the information I've just given you, have a look at some of the scientifically tested benefits of adding HIIT strength sessions to your regular exercise regimen (or, if you're fresh off the couch and just starting, why HIIT should be part of whatever you're planning to try, be it a simple walking program or something more ambitious). I think you'll be happy you did.<br><br>HIIT--specifically, with strength training--helps deliver a bigger burn.<br><br>I touched on this just now, but we haven't talked about the benefits of strength training (as opposed to steady-state cardio like running or cycling). A small study in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise1 monitored the oxygen consumption (known as VO2 max, a measurement based on body weight and lung capacity) of 15 men as they performed interval-style weight training for 27 minutes, and then, 5 days later, ran steady-state on treadmills to achieve identical VO2 levels for 27 minutes. In other words, they did weight training and treadmill running at the same effort level for the same amount of time. The result? Total oxygen consumption was higher for 30 minutes after the weight-training workout.<br><br>Another study--this time of seven women ages 22 to 35, in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism,2--showed elevated metabolic rate for 3 hours after an intense resistance workout, compared with pre-exercise levels. To boot, resting fat oxidation was elevated 2 days after the workout.<br><br>That's exciting stuff. HIIT has long been thought to help boost metabolism and "afterburn." Still, some data have shown that the fitter you are, the lower your EPOC. A study of 10 men in the journal BMC Research Notes in 20123 showed just that--though this study looked at cardio, not strength training.<br><br>These are small studies and just examples of what kind of research has been going on in the world of HIIT, but they give a glimpse of the overall potential benefits. In conclusion, the harder you work, the more physiologically efficient you'll become, achieving better results in less time.<br><br>What about Cardio?<br><br>I compare HIIT to steady-state cardio a lot in this chapter. That doesn't mean I'm anti-cardio. I run, bike, and swim more than most folks as I train for Ironman triathlons. I love those activities and wouldn't give them up for anything. They bring unbelievable mental and physical rewards. But as much as I want to do them, I want to have total-body fitness. I want the strength and flexibility that HIIT gives me. And my HIIT workouts have improved my steady-state performance. There's no downside.<br><br>But here's another reason I love HIIT for strength: You work your muscles, but you also work at an intensity high enough to give you a first-rate cardio challenge while simultaneously building strength. My patients often ask, "Is this a strength day or a cardio day?" The truth is that when you do HIIT, it's just a day. You're building both strength and cardiopulmonary fitness at the same time. You can do nothing but these workouts a few times a week and get yourself stronger and in great cardiovascular shape. Now that's a comprehensive workout.<br><br>Can a 10-Minute Workout Really Deliver Health and Fitness Benefits?<br><br>Yes, it can. Research has begun to consistently bear this out: A recent study in the journal PLOS ONE4 had otherwise-healthy obese participants perform 3 minutes of intense intermittent exercise within a 30-minute weekly training time commitment for 6 weeks (three sessions of 10 minutes that included 1 minute of intervals per week). The results: improved oxygen consumption, lower blood pressure, and increased insulin sensitivity. And that was just from adding 1 minute of intense exercise in a 10-minute training window three times a week.</p><h2>Moonwalking With Einstein</h2><p>Foer's unlikely journey from chronically forgetful science journalist to U.S. Memory Champion frames a revelatory exploration of the vast, hidden impact of memory on every aspect of our lives.<br>On average, people squander forty days annually compensating for things they've forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories.<br>Moonwalking with Einstein draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of memory, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top "mental athletes," he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten, Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories.<br>Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers, Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination-showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system, which converts numbers into lurid images, to the memory palace, in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures, Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity.<br>Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego, he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record, where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think. In Salt Lake City, he swaps secrets with a savant who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. At a high school in the South Bronx, he finds a history teacher using twenty- five-hundred-year-old memory techniques to give his students an edge in the state Regents exam.<br>At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete, Foer's bid to resurrect the forgotten art of remembering becomes an urgent quest. Moonwalking with Einstein brings Joshua Foer to the apex of the U.S. Memory Championship and readers to a profound appreciation of a gift we all possess but that too often slips our minds.<br></p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2011</strong>: <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> follows Joshua Foer's compelling journey as a participant in the U.S. Memory Championship. As a science journalist covering the competition, Foer became captivated by the secrets of the competitors, like how the current world memory champion, Ben Pridmore, could memorize the exact order of 1,528 digits in an hour. He met with individuals whose memories are truly unique&#x2014;from one man whose memory only extends back to his most recent thought, to another who can memorize complex mathematical formulas without knowing any math. Brains remember visual imagery but have a harder time with other information, like lists, and so with the help of experts, Foer learned how to transform the kinds of memories he forgot into the kind his brain remembered naturally. The techniques he mastered made it easier to remember information, and Foer's story demonstrates that the tricks of the masters are accessible to anyone. <br> <em>--Miriam Landis</em> <br> <br> <strong>Author Q&amp;A with Joshua Foer</strong> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> First, can you explain the title of you book, <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em>?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The title refers to a memory device I used in the US Memory Championship&#x2014;specifically it's a mnemonic that helped me memorize a deck of playing cards. Moonwalking with Einstein works as a mnemonic because it's such a goofy image. Things that are weird or colorful are the most memorable. If you try to picture Albert Einstein sliding backwards across a dance floor wearing penny loafers and a diamond glove, that's pretty much unforgettable.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the U.S. Memory Championships? How did you become involved?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The U.S. Memory Championship is a rather bizarre contest held each spring in New York City, in which people get together to see who can remember the most names of strangers, the most lines of poetry, the most random digits. I went to the event as a science journalist, to cover what I assumed would be the Super Bowl of savants. But when I talked to the competitors, they told me something really interesting. They weren't savants. And they didn't have photographic memories. Rather, they'd trained their memories using ancient techniques. They said anyone could do it. I was skeptical. Frankly, I didn't believe them. I said, well, if anyone can do it, could you teach me? A guy named Ed Cooke, who has one of the best trained memories in the world, took me under his wing and taught me everything he knew about memory techniques. A year later I came back to the contest, this time to try and compete, as a sort of exercise in participatory journalism. I was curious simply to see how well I'd do, but I ended up winning the contest. That really wasn't supposed to happen.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the most surprising thing you found out about yourself competing in the Memory Championships?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In the process of studying these techniques, I learned something remarkable: that there's far more potential in our minds than we often give them credit for. I'm not just talking about the fact that it's possible to memorize lots of information using memory techniques. I'm talking about a lesson that is more general, and in a way much bigger: that it's possible, with training and hard work, to teach oneself to do something that might seem really difficult.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you explain the "OK Plateau?"</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The OK Plateau is that place we all get to where we just stop getting better at something. Take typing, for example. You might type and type and type all day long, but once you reach a certain level, you just never get appreciably faster at it. That's because it's become automatic. You've moved it to the back of your mind's filing cabinet. If you want to become a faster typer, it's possible, of course. But you've got to bring the task back under your conscious control. You've got to push yourself past where you're comfortable. You have to watch yourself fail and learn from your mistakes. That's the way to get better at anything. And it's how I improved my memory.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you mean by saying there an "art" to memory?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The "art of memory" refers to a set of techniques that were invented in ancient Greece. These are the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his speeches, and that medieval scholars used to memorize entire books. The "art" is in creating imagery in your mind that is so unusual, so colorful, so unlike anything you've ever seen before that it's unlikely to be forgotten. That's why mnemonists like to say that their skills are as much about creativity as memory.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you think technology has affected how and what we remember?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Once upon a time people invested in their memories, they cultivated them. They studiously furnished their minds. They remembered. Today, of course, we've got books, and computers and smart phones to hold our memories for us. We've outsourced our memories to external devices. The result is that we no longer trust our memories. We see every small forgotten thing as evidence that they're failing us altogether. We've forgotten how to remember.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the connection between memory and our sense of time?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> As we get older, life seems to fly by faster and faster. That's because we structure our experience of time around memories. We remember events in relation to other events. But as we get older, and our experiences become less unique, our memories can blend together. If yesterday's lunch is indistinguishable from the one you ate the day before, it'll end up being forgotten. That's why it's so hard to remember meals. In the same way, if you're not doing things that are unique and different and memorable, this year can come to resemble the last, and end up being just as forgettable as yesterday's lunch. That's why it's so important to pack your life with interesting experiences that make your life memorable, and provide a texture to the passage of time.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How is your memory now?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Ironically, not much better than when I started this whole journey. The techniques I learned, and used in the memory contest, are great for remembering structured information like shopping lists or phone numbers, but they don't improve any sort of underlying, generalizable memory ability. Unfortunately, I still misplace my car keys.</p> <p>(Photo of Joshua Foer � Emil Salman Haaretz)</p><b>Joshua Foer</b> has written for <i>National Geographic, Esquire, The New York Times, The Washington Post</i>, and <i>Slate</i>.</p><h2>Children&#39;s Ministry in the 21st Century: The Encyclopedia of Practical Ideas</h2><p>Get ready for what's coming next in Children's Ministry...<br>Here's how.<br><br>Ten front-line Children's Ministry experts peeked out over the horizon to identify ten trends shaping ministry in the next ten years.<br>See inside to discover...<br><b>How current culture is rewiring kids' brains</b>--and secrets for connecting with children<br><b>The latest education trends embraced by schools</b>--and how they'll impact your Sunday school<br><b>Morphing Children's Ministry into Family Ministry</b>--and how that supersizes your impact<br><b>What kinds of children are about to land in your ministry</b>--and how to be ready for them<br><b>Plus six more must-know insights</b>--and practical activities that help you take advantage of shifting trends in your Children's Ministry.<br><br><b>Be prepared.</b><br>It's good advice for scouts...and even better advice for you.</p><p></p><h2>Tough Guys Don&#39;t Dance</h2><p>"A novel that is as brash and brooding and ultimately as mesmerizing as the author himself...The dazzling balance betwen humor and horror keeps us plunging on....As for characters, each is a gem....It is a book to read with infinite pleasures."<br>NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br>Tim Madden awakes one morning with a gruesome hangover, a painful tatoo on his upper arm, blood all over the passenger seat of his Porsche, a severed female head in his marijuana stash, and almost no memory of his actions on the preceding evening.

NEW YORK TIMES</p><h2>Promises, Promises: Essays On Literature And Psychoanalysis</h2><p>As an essayist, Adam Phillips combines the best of two worlds: a mastery of psychotherapy as both practitioner and theorist, and a reputation as one of the best literary writers around. In this collection of essays, he brings these two gifts to bear upon each other, speculating on the relative merits of psychoanalysis and literature and on the connections between them. In his quirky, epigrammatic style, Phillips shows us how psychoanalysis and literature at their best share the goal of shedding light on human character, the most fascinating of disorders.Promises, Promises reveals Phillips as a virtuoso performer able to reach far beyond the borders of psychoanalytic discourse, into art, novels, poetry, and history. This collection gives us insights into Martin Amis&#39;s Night Train, Nijinsky&#39;s diary, Tom Stoppard and A. E. Housman, Amy Clampitt, the effect of the Blitz on Londoners, and a case history of clutter. It confirms Phillips as a writer whose work, in the words of the Guardian, &#34;hovers in a strange and haunting borderland between rigour and delight.&#34;</p><p>Adam Phillips has been called &#34;the closest thing we have to a philosopher of happiness.&#34; Formerly Principal Child Psychotherapist at Charing Cross Hospital in London, he is the author of such works as Winnicott; On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored; Monogamy; On Flirtation; Terror and Experts; and Darwin&#39;s Worms.Phillips, a well-known psychotherapist and literary critic, believes that the "talking cure" of psychoanalysis, dependent as it is upon language, is inextricably linked to literature. Accordingly, he has produced a number of insightful essays that explore the relationship between the literary arts and the unconscious. In this new collection of book reviews, lectures, and critical pieces, Phillips juxtaposes anecdotes from his own psychotherapy practice with discussions of works by an eclectic group of authors: A.E. Housman, Melanie Klein, Fernando Pessoa, Fritz Wittels, and Hart Crane, to name just a few. Not surprisingly, he also includes liberal references in many of the pieces to Freud's writings and theories. A useful addition to interdisciplinary studies, this unique book is recommended for academic collections.

What little bitterness she shows is aimed at the sorry ways that blacks were treated by whites during much of her life. &#34;I don&#39;t remember a single doctor deliverin a black baby at home,&#34; she says. &#34;...Cause if they sent for him the baby woulda been there and probably some of em walkin befo&#39; he got there.&#34; Interviewer Katherine Clark stitches together the flow of words seamlessly without cleaning them up; Logan comes across as a garrulous old friend rocking on the porch, whiling away a hot afternoon in talk.Logan is a black "granny" (a formally untutored midwife) whose oral autobiography has been faithfully transcribed and presented as a history of one woman's considerable efforts to provide safe deliveries for the rural poor and for those desiring home birth in Alabama from approximately 1925 to 1984. Logan tells an interesting story which includes hard work, an abiding faith in God, a deep respect for Afro-American folklore and tradition, and myriad details of the process of midwifery. While the content is fascinating, the many repetitions, half-finished sentences, and idiomatic English make this book difficult to read, though it captures the personality and character of Logan quite well.<br><i>- Julie Semkow, Health Sciences Ctr . , SUNY at Brooklyn</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Open World: The Collected Poems 1960-2000</h2><p>His vision is a remarkably consistent one and the same elements recur again and again&#x2014;rocks, sea, mist, gulls and the natural world.

I immigrated to America from South Africa in 1977. One of my first assignments was with James A. Michener, the renowned historical novelist, working for two years as assistant on his South African book, The Covenant. We spoke about countries with an epic history that would lend itself to a novel on a grand scale. One of the places I suggested was Brazil. <p>It was critical to have first-hand experience of the country. I began my research in Portugal, before traveling to Brazil, where I covered 15,000 miles, almost exclusively by bus to get a feel for that vast country. My journey took me into the sert�o, the arid backlands of the Northeast and to the Casas Grandes of coastal Pernambuco. I voyaged the Amazon from Belm to Manaus and rode by bus down to southernmost Rondonia. I followed the route of the bandeirantes, the Brazilian pathfinders, west of So Paulo and roamed the highlands of Minas Gerais. </p><p>The writing of Brazil took five years. Like my fictional hero, Amador Flores da Silva, I knew periods of utter loneliness and fear; times when I felt the caatinga closing in on me but always, I broke through the barrier. I never lost the will to understand the Brazilian thing. </p><p>I could ask no greater reward for my work than its review by Wilson Martins, one of Brazils most distinguished critics: Uys has accomplished what no Brazilian author from Jos de Alencar to Jorge Amado was able to do. He is the first to write our national epic in all its decisive episodes, from the indigenous civilization and the El Dorado myth, everything converging like the segments of a rose window to that reborn and metamorphosed myth that is Brasilia. He is the first outsider to see us with total honesty and sympathy and full empathy with the decisive moments in our history and their spiritual meaning. Descriptions like those of the war with Paraguay are unsurpassed in our literature and evoke the great passages of War and Peace.</p>Errol Lincoln Uys is a renowned writer and editor. He was the editor-in-chief of Reader&#39;s Digest in South Africa, and collaborated with James A.

Yet the novel is much more. Written in sparse prose that is shockingly clear -- the descriptions of electronic treatments are particularly harrowing -- it combines real-life characters and events with fictional ones in a work that examines the insanity of war like no other. Barker also weaves in issues of class and politics in this compactly powerful book. Other books in the series include The Eye in the Door and the Booker Award winner The Ghost Road.<b>PAT BARKER</b> has earned a place in the first rank of contemporary British writers with such novels as <i>Union Street</i>, <i>Regeneration</i> (shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize and chosen by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the four best novels of 1992), <i>The Eye in the Door</i> (winner of the 1993 Guardian fiction prize), and <i>The Ghost Road</i> (winner of the 1995 Booker Prize).

Reissue.</p><p>Carson McCullers was born in 1917. She is the critically acclaimed author of several popular novels in the 1940s and &#39;50s, including The Member of the Wedding (1946). Her novels frequently depicted life in small towns of the southeastern United States and were marked by themes of loneliness and spiritual isolation. McCullers suffered from ill health most of her adult life, including a series of strokes that began when she was in her 20s; she died at the age of 50. The Member of the Wedding was dramatized for the stage in the 1950s and filmed in 1952 and 1997. Other films based on her books are Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967, with Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando), The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (1968, starring Alan Arkin) and The Ballad of the Sad Cafe (1991).Novel by Carson Mccullers, published in 1941. Set in the 1930s on a Southern army base, the novel concerns the relationships between self-destructive misfits whose lives end in tragedy and murder. The cast of characters includes Captain Penderton, a sadomasochistic, latent homosexual officer; his wife, who is having an affair with Major Langdon; the major's wife, who responds to the trauma of her son's death with self-mutilation; Anacleto, a homosexual servant who is befriended by the major's wife; and an army private who engages in voyeurism. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Poster Book</h2><p>The movie event of the summer is here!

She teaches art, design, photography and art history and is the author of many books on art history and instruction.<p>Gr 4-8--These books cover a lot more material than one would expect to find in 32 pages. Painting, mosaic, pottery, architecture, and sculpture are all introduced, with some of the most prominent examples chosen to illustrate and expand upon the narrative. Lengthy captions for the photographs and illustrations provide additional information. Fact boxes are interspersed to clarify points of history and/or art. Words in bold face are defined in a brief glossary; illustrations are included in the index. There are some inconsistencies; e.g., the word "encaustic" is defined in the texts rather than in the glossaries, and a few dates in the narratives that don't appear in the concluding time lines. In Roman Art, a tool called a "groma" is referred to and yet there is no picture or description of one. Both titles show a "color palette," but don't include all of the colors that are used in the works of art shown. Despite these minor faults, the books contain a great deal of excellent information, are well organized and easy to read, and would be solid purchases for introducing the art of these two ancient cultures.</p><p><i>Marilyn Fairbanks, East Junior High School, Brockton, MA</i></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>That Which You Are Seeking Is Causing You to Seek</h2><p>The teachings of Zen are presented to Westerners in this book, which is comprised of many short sections accompanied by illustrations on subjects ranging from compassion and meditation to death.

By the illustrator of Green Wilma.</p><p>Born in Elmira, New York, Tedd grew up in a family of six with three brothers. His family lived on a farm in Pennsylvania for several years then returned to Elmira until Tedd was ten years old. His father's work then required that they move to Gainesville, Florida. There, Tedd's first art lessons in an abandoned dentist's office over the Happy Hour pool hall eventually led to a fine arts degree from the University of Florida. He and his wife, Carol, started their family in Tallahassee where Tedd worked as a commercial illustrator. Carol, a Kindergarten teacher, drew Tedd's attention to children's books. Their first son, Walter, inspired his breakthrough picture book, <i>No Jumping on the Bed!</i>. His second son, William, now stars in <i>No More Water in the Tub!</i>, a sequel to his first book. He has now published more than 30 books as author and illustrator. When not working on his books, Tedd's interests include tennis, sketching, reading, coin collecting, and the computer.<p>"The inspiration to begin writing and illustrating for children came from my wife, Carol. As a kindergarten teacher, she collected picture books. I was attracted to their colorful pages and the way the words and pictures played with each other, much like the captioned cartoons I had drawn when I was young.</p><p>"Perhaps the biggest surprise of my career as an author is that I'm now going back to elementary school! Visiting young readers in classrooms and libraries is something I love. Kids keep me on my toes and they ask a lot of questions. The number one question seems to be, 'Where do you getyour ideas?' It's also the hardest question to answer because every idea is different. Some ideas seem to pop out of thin air -- while I'm in the shower or walking the dog. Others come from reading or research. But most of my ideas come from my family and the things they do and say.</p><p>"For instance, one time when my first son, Walter, was five years old, I found him lying on the couch, looking pale as a ghost and clutching a Bible to his chest. He was praying! When I asked what was wrong, he wouldn't answer. In fact, he wouldn't even open his mouth. My wife, Carol, finally coaxed a response from him: he pointed inside his mouth. Carol exclaimed, 'You have a loose tooth!' Walter's eyes nearly popped out with fright. We quickly assured him that it was perfectly okay for his tooth to come loose and that a new one would replace it. But Carol and I looked at each other and realized that despite all our efforts to be good parents, we had somehow completely forgotten to warn Walter that teeth fall out! He had thought he was falling apart! I made a little note in my journal; then ten years later, I expanded that memory into my book <i>Parts</i>."</p><p>Tedd Arnold lives in Elmira, New York, with his wife, Carol, two sons, Walter and William, two cats, Cody and Frankie, and one dog, Hershey.</p><p>copyright ? 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

My decision depends on you." Annie always answers, "Do snowplows plow? Do tow trucks tow? Are school buses yellow? Of course I'll make it up Tiger Hill!" Thanks to her, the local schools never have a snow day. This enrages Shifty Rhodes, a lazy bus driver whose very name suggests icy conditions. With a crooked ski-resort owner (aptly called Hale Snow), Shifty conspires to use a snowmaking machine on Tiger Hill. Needless to say, Annie (with a little help from her friends) rises to the challenge. Pulver (Nobody's Mother Is in Second Grade) creates a memorable character in Annie, who welcomes both children and stranded motorists aboard her bus. Arnold (Green Wilma; Huggly Takes a Bath) portrays her as a woman who joyously greets a snowstorm by standing in front of an open window. Annie's excited smile never leaves her face, and she sports a brown leather aviator's jacket, a woolly flight cap and goggles when she takes the wheel. True, Annie pushes the envelope of safety, and the author doesn't account for the glee of Annie's young passengers, who can't wait to get to school. Nevertheless, this lively tale of an idiosyncratic bus driver may warm a chilly crowd on a would-be snow day.

The presence almost overwhelming of feminine figures (rural and urban women, young or elder, married or single, raw and sophisticated...) is the leading thread of this collection. Their decisions, vital choices, their problems, the situations they have to face due to the fact that they belong to the so-called weak sex (the girl deserted by her boyfriend after the engagement, the doubts before birth, the anguish of the eldest girl, who has disappointed deeply her mother&#39;s expectations over her...etc) are portrayed in a sympathetic and honest way; you can&#39;t avoid feeling sorry for some of them: the heroine that has made the wrong choice, the mother submitted to an inebriate husband, the woman that can&#39;t escape from an adulterous love.... In this sense the last sentence of the first story, The Connor Girls, is revealing: By such choices we (women) gradually become exiles, until at last we are quite alone, because it introduces what is going to be one of the main points of most of the stories: loneliness, women&#39;s loneliness in the face of men, in the face of other women integrated in the system, in short, in the face of this world of men. What is the result of all this? I think that the feeling that pervades the whole book is that of sadness, an acute pain with which the writer could be exorcising her own.</p><p><p> Philip Roth, acclaimed author of <strong>Portnoy's Complaint</strong>, <strong>The Human Stain</strong> and many other works of fiction, is the recipient of numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts from the White House.</p></p><h2>Religious Affections: True Faith Shows Itself in the Fruit of the Spirit and Christlike Living (Faith Classics)</h2><p><p>You probably know him for preaching the sermon &#x201c;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&#x201d;&#x2014;but Jonathan Edwards had much more to say about the Christian life.

Edwards shows that the evidence of true conversion are the &#x201c;religious affections&#x201d;&#x2014;the fruit of the Spirit as described in Galatians 5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was a preacher, theologian, and missionary to Native Americans. Edwards &#34;is widely acknowledged to be America&#39;s most important and original philosophical theologian, &#34;and one of America&#39;s greatest intellectuals. Edwards&#39;s theological work is very broad in scope, but he is often associated with his defense of Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life&#39;s work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a very critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first fires of revival in 1733-1735 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. Edwards delivered the sermon &#34;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&#34;, a classic of early American literature, during another wave of revival in 1741, following George Whitefield&#39;s tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is widely known for his many books: The End For Which God Created the World; The Life of David Brainerd, which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the nineteenth century; and Religious Affections, which many Reformed Evangelicals read even today.

In <i>Lion in the White House: A Life of Theodore Roosevelt</i>, historian Aida Donald masterfully chronicles the life of this first modern president. TR's accomplishments in office were immense. As President, Roosevelt redesigned the office of Chief Executive and the workings of the Republican Party to meet the challenges of the new industrial economy. Believing that the emerging aristocracy of wealth represented a genuine threat to democracy, TR broke trusts to curb the rapacity of big business. He improved economic and social conditions for the average American. Roosevelt built the Panama Canal and engaged the country in world affairs, putting a temporary end to American isolationism. And he won the Nobel Peace Prize-the only sitting president ever so honored. Throughout his public career, TR fought valiantly to steer the GOP back to its noblest ideals as embodied by Abraham Lincoln. Alas, his hopes for his party were quashed by the GOP's strong rightward turn in the years after he left office. But his vision for America lives on. In lapidary prose, this concise biography recounts the courageous life of one of the greatest leaders our nation has ever known.</p><p><b>Aida D. Donald</b> has spent a lifetime with American history. Editor-in-chief of Harvard University Press for many years, she also worked at publisher Hill &amp;Wang, the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the Johns Hopkins University Press. A former Fulbright Fellow at Oxford University, Donald holds a Ph.D. in American history and has taught at Columbia University. She lives in Lincoln, Massachusetts, with her husband and fellow historian David Herbert Donald.Theodore Roosevelt called himself a Progressive--a category that is no longer part of our political lexicon. But Roosevelt was not a man interested in fitting any mold. With his boundless energy and intelligence he conquered New York City politics, rode the range, fought in the Spanish-American War, penned numerous bestselling histories and biographies, created the National Park System, promoted the building of the Panama Canal, and won the Nobel Peace Prize (the only sitting United States president to have done so). Donald's work is billed as an "affectionate" biography. In every inflection and adjective, narrator Pam Ward mirrors the author's admiration for the man who is often considered to be the country's first modern president.

Yume travels to Tokyo to begin her magic-user classes. As soon as she steps off the train, she gets into trouble for using her magic too frivolously; the government pays magic users to alleviate suffering, like restoring severed limbs and resurrecting dead children. Unlike other stories that have magic-wielding teens as major characters, this title provides a larger overview that explains how the characters fit into the world around them. There are plenty of winsome, long-haired boys to make the teen blush and trip over herself, and Yume does not resemble the typical manga girl lead: she has shorter hair and is rather plain. The plotline has some tender moments, centered on a lost child and a lost love, which are unusually serious for manga. This title is one of the sharper and more intelligent offerings in the genre.<i>&#x2013;John Leighton, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the age of 13, while visiting family friends deep in the Guinean bush, witnessing Africa&#39;s energy and anarchy was a formative experience. A little over ten years later - having studied in Glasgow and Vancouver, deepened my travel appetite with student jaunts to eastern Europe and Nepal, taken a postgraduate journalism course in London, and worked on magazine features desks - I returned to Africa. This time I went overland - across the Sahara and along the River Niger to Timbuktu. The plan was to fill a bag in the sub-Saharan markets with CDs and cassettes of the wonderful local music. Four months later, having crossed Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Mali (in both directions), I got back to London with more than just a bundle of poor-quality tapes. I was now determined to pursue a life of travelling, writing about it, and eventually getting paid for the results. I soon sold an article about staying with Senegalese griot musicians to the Guardian, and set my sights on Australia. After two years in Sydney, writing about travel, music and media for publications including the Australian and Ministry of Sound- and MTV-branded magazines, I landed my first Lonely Planet gig. Given my African experiences, my first LP assignment was to update the Togo and Benin chapters of the West Africa guide. Over the next half-decade, LP jobs in India, Ireland, Canada, America, the UK, Turkey, South Africa, China and Morocco followed. These days, as well as contributing to LP and Time Out guides, I write for worldwide publications from magazines to mobile apps. Following a stint in Istanbul, my girlfriend and I live in Cape Town, from where I regularly venture into Africa and beyond.&#34; To learn more about James, visit his webpage: http://www.jamesbainbridge.net/index.html</p><h2>A Visual Dictionary of Victorian Life (Crabtree Visual Dictionaries, 5)</h2><p>This illustrated dictionary introduces readers to life in North America during the Victorian era, between 1837 and 1901.

Dark red instead of bright and frothy, which would indicate a lung hit, or the thick yellowish slime of a gut shot. A muscle wound. Not enough to kill, even with time. Only enough to wound, to hurt...to enrage.<br><i>Worse than a miss</i>.<br>And now it was his responsibility to sort it out. It was his job as a professional hunter to host, guide, advise, nursemaid, and clean up after his client. That meant listening to hunters' yarns and outright lies told around the campfires, supplying four-star meals and Five Star Hennesey, and catering to requests and whims. It also meant anchoring poorly shot cripples before they escaped to die a slow, lingering death or turned and charged, bent on a bit of justifiable homicide.<br><i>Every hunter's worst nightmare</i>.<br>* * *<br><i>The lion lay in a small pool of blood, watching the narrow channel of his own trail through the tall grass. He flattened himself in a clump of grass so small one would never suspect the danger lurking there, his tawny coat and shaggy mane blending in perfect camouflage with his hiding place. He gathered his three good legs beneath him for the charge that would carry him forward. The fourth was shattered and useless, but that wouldn't matter. His claws were for holding, while his teeth did the killing. A single bite could sever the spine of a zebra or crush the skull of a man.</i><br><i>The wound had begun to hurt, now that the initial shock had worn off. At first he had snapped and bit at the pain, roaring his anger, but now rage had transcended agony and he no longer heeded the searing, throbbing pain of the bullet. He thought only of the men who were following him, and he knew that if he remained still they would come within reach of his revenge</i>.<br>* * *<br>Jon Sable reached into the pocket of his bush jacket and pulled out a small cheesecloth sack of <i>mopane</i> ashes, gently shaking it to release a puff of fine gray powder that drifted on the almost imperceptible air currents. The wind had been fickle, changing direction in light swirls and eddies stirred by temperature changes and rising thermals, rather than a steady breeze. Not that it mattered much; the lion was probably already watching them, waiting somewhere in the acre-sized patch of grass for the opportunity to spring from ambush. Following a wounded lion into tangled thornbush and tall grass is a hell of a way to make a living. Do it often enough, and the odds against you build to roughly those of finding a Krugerrand in your Cracker Jack box.<br>At Sable's feet, Jacob Inyati crouched low in the grass, examining the spoor like a hunting dog. Jacob was barefoot and stripped to a breechclout, revealing ripcord muscles beneath his ebony skin. Like his Zulu ancestors, he carried a long-bladed assegai, not merely for "local color" but also because the spear was a proven weapon against thin-skinned animals. In another era, Jacob would have hunted this lion alone, with only his spear and shield. But at this moment he was just as happy to have Sable armed with his .375 Holland &amp; Holland Magnum.<br>Sable took off his battered hat and ran his fingers through the sweat-soaked tangle of black hair, glancing back to be certain that his portly client, Phillip Hathaway, a New Jersey stockbroker, had remained where he was told, standing in the back of the Land Rover. Sable had explained that this was to give him a vantage point in case the lion broke from cover. In truth, it was to keep him the hell out of the way.<br>Hathaway had begun this deadly situation with a bad shot from the shiny new .378 Weatherby that Sable had recognized as trouble the first time Hathaway took it out of its leather case. Sable wished just once he'd get a client who owned only one rifle and had used it enough to beat the hell out of it--some scratches in the stock...a little wear in the bluing...anything that indicated the guy knew how to use it.<br>Hardly anyone came to Africa on their first hunting trip, so clients usually had at least one rifle with which they were familiar and comfortable. Then they'd go out and buy something "special" for their big trip, something that bit at both ends and scared the hell out of them, so they wound up flinching in anticipation of the recoil and sending the bullet God knows where.<br>If it was a miss, it was no problem. Sable would just smile and agree that there must be something wrong with the sights. He'd tell a few self-deprecating stories of some of his own misses to bolster his client's ego. But if it was a bad hit, there was no choice but to follow up the shot, track the animal down, and sort it out.<br>Strangely, Sable didn't find it hypocritical that he loved the animals he hunted as much as he loved hunting itself. But he hated hurting them and didn't like to see them suffer. There are no peaceful deaths for the wild; animals only die of drought, disease, starvation, or depredation. Given the options, one could argue that a well-placed bullet might be a mercy. Sable had drummed it into every client he took into the bush: when you make the decision to kill, you must do everything in your power to make it a quick and humane death. If the opportunity presented itself, Sable would try to see that the client fired the final killing shot. Sometimes, however, there was no question that he was going to have to clean up the mess himself.<br>Still, Hathaway had done fairly well during the sight-in session Sable required of all his clients. And, in ten days of hunting, he had shot a number of fine trophies. Sable had begun to feel optimistic.<br>But among the animals on Hathaway's shopping list of trophies was lion.<br>They had hunted hard for signs of a recent kill in hopes of building a hide and waiting in ambush for the lion to return to feed. It would have to be a fresh kill of a large animal, such as a zebra, in order to survive the onslaught of the scavengers; Africa's cleanup crews are always alert for a free meal. Then word arrived of a cattle-killing lion a few miles upriver. A rancher had lost several head of young stock and would be delighted to have the cat permanently relocated to Hathaway's den.<br>Sable and Jacob bent to examine the tracks that led off into a tiny thicket nearby. It was a large print, broader than a man's hand. A big cat. Solitary. Perhaps an old king, deposed and driven out of the pride by a new ruler.<br>No sooner had they begun to follow the tracks than the lion, a mature male with a golden mane, broke for cover fifty yards away. Hathaway swung and fired as the big cat disappeared into the sea of grass, and Sable knew his day had just gone to hell.<br>"What do you think. Jack?" Hathaway inquired as Sable stood listening to the terrible roars emanating from the tall grass. Sable ignored him as he had every time the man had called him Jack for the past ten days. The guy just never seemed to get the message. "Maybe we should leave him for the night, let him stiffen up, come back with beaters--"<br>Sable turned cold gray eyes on Hathaway, eyes that told him that they were not about to do any such thing.<br>"First rule of the hunt, Mr. Hathaway: never leave a wounded animal to suffer," he said in a calm voice that surprised even himself. "We are not going to leave him overnight, and we are not going to send men in there after him."<br>Hathaway scuttled back a step. Maybe Sable's voice hadn't been quite as calm as he thought. "I was just...I didn't mean--"<br>Sable cut him off. "He's in pain, and he'll take it out on anything that comes his way, whether it's you or me or the next villager who crosses his path."<br>He turned back to the roaring thunder rumbling through the tall grass. "And now that he's crippled," he said grimly, "he won't be able to hunt his usual prey, so he's going to turn to the easiest thing he can catch. If we don't finish him now, we'll wind up with a man-eater."<br>He opened the action of his rifle and made certain that the chambers held two soft-nosed bullets. The rifle represented the ultimate product of the finest artisans in the firearms field, Holland &amp; Holland. This was the Royal Ejector model, an old piece manufactured in the 1950s. Its twin twenty-six-inch barrels were chambered for the versatile .375 Holland &amp; Holland Magnum that delivered a 300-grain slug with over two tons of energy. Set into the rib between the barrels was an express sight that sported folding leaves calibrated to an optimistic 400 yards. In this case, ranges would be measured in feet or inches, not yards.<br>Sable snapped the action shut and palmed two more cartridges in his left hand against the bottom of the forearm. The old white hunter's trick of sticking cartridges between your fingers only worked with flanged cases like the old .470 Nitro Express; belted Magnums like the .375 H&amp;H had no rim and would pop out under recoil. Satisfied, he pushed the safety off. He wouldn't have time to fumble with it.<br>"Maybe you can live with that back in New Jersey," he said to Hathaway, "but I have to live here."<br>* * *<br><i>The errant shift in the air currents carried the man scent to him, overpowering even the smell of his own blood. He fought the urge to scream his rage. He knew his speed and he knew instinctively how close he must let them come before launching his attack. He would give them no warning. He stilled himself, sinking even lower into the grass, vanishing</i>.<br>* * *<br>Sable and Jacob had long since developed a silent communication that served them well in situations like this: gestures, glances, subtle shifts in posture. The two men worked as a team, each depending on the other for survival. Jacob concentrated on following the spoor, which freed Sable to focus all his attention on the surrounding bush, searching for some telltale sign of the lion's presence that would give them even a moment's warning.<br>They didn't get it.<br>The charge was sudden and silent and came from an unexpected quarter, where the lion had doubled back to lie in ambush along the trail of his own blood. Only a brief flicker of movement caught Jacob's eye...The violence of modern African life overwhelms a gamekeeper whose family is murdered by poachers in this fast-moving but hackneyed adventure debut by comics artist Grell. Jon Sable, hero of the comic book Jon Sable, Freelance, brings little depth to his role as the novel's protagonist, living his dream of running a safari company in Tanzania. He is forced to accept a job as a gamekeeper when business turns slow, and he's so good in his new career that poachers take revenge, murdering his wife and children and leaving the wounded Sable near death. Sable survives, but his psyche is shattered, and he goes on a killing spree, taking down poachers and forcing a second confrontation with the man who destroyed his family. That encounter lands Sable in prison. He gets out quickly, however, when invited to join a mercenary group attempting to rescue a wealthy industrialist's son who's surrounded by military terrorists in a game park. After being wounded in the rescue, Sable goes to New York for a break, where he meets the literary agent who rejected his novel but who now accepts his proposal for a series of children's books. Sable's ensuing literary success catapults him into a new life, but his old one returns to haunt him when he's stalked by an assassin, and he must return to Africa to track the man who put a price on his head. Grell supplies a nonstop stream of violent action. His protagonist lacks vibrancy and complexity, however. The author misses the chance to provide an in-depth look at the cultural and economic conflicts of contemporary Africa, and instead pads his book with clich d plot and characters.

It was compiled around 1260 by Jacobus de Voragine, a scholarly friar and eventual archbishop of Genoa, whose purpose was to captivate, encourage, and edify the faithful, while preserving a vast store of information pertaining to the legends and traditions of the church. In his new translation, the first in English of the complete text, William Granger Ryan captures the immediacy of this rich, image-filled work, and offers an important guide for readers interested in medieval art and literature and, more generally, in popular religious culture.</p><br><p> These stories have the effect of bringing the saints to life as real people, in the context of late thirteenth-century living, but in them the saints do things that ordinary people can only wonder at. There is St. Juliana, who, fed up with the propositions of a dull-witted demon, gives him a sound thrashing and tosses him in the sewer; St. Hilary, who challenges the authority of a corrupt pope and foresees the prelate's death; and St. James the Dismembered, who, with the chopping off of each body part by the Roman executioner, joyfully proclaims yet another reason for loving God.</p><br><p> In the course of reading these stories, which are arranged according to the order of saints' feast days throughout the liturgical year, we happen upon many fascinating cultural and historical topics, such as the Christianization of Roman holidays, the symbolism behind the monk's tonsure, Nero's "pregnancy," and the reason why chaste but hot-blooded women can grow beards. At the same time these stories draw abundantly on Holy Scripture to shed light on the mysteries of the Christian faith. The chapters devoted to Christ and to the Blessed Virgin are particularly moving examples of the mingling of doctrine and narrative to give life to dogma.</p></p><p><b>William Granger Ryan,</b> a priest of the diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, is President Emeritus of Seton Hill College and a research scholar at the Institute of Sacred Music, Worship, and the Arts, Yale University.

He perched on the blue roof of Moomin house and cuckooed eight times&#x2014;rather hoarsely to be sure, for it was still a bit early in the spring.<br>Then he flew away to the east.<br>Moomintroll woke up and lay a long time looking at the ceiling before he realized where he was. He had slept a hundred nights and a hundred days, and his dreams still thronged about his head trying to coax him back to sleep.<br>But as he was wriggling around trying to find a cozy new spot to sleep he caught sight of something that made him quite wide awake&#x2014;Snufkin&#x2019;s bed was empty!<br>Moomintroll sat up. Yes, Snufkin&#x2019;s hat had gone, too. &#x201c;Goodness gracious me!&#x201d; he said, tiptoeing to the open window. Ah-ha, Snufkin had been using the rope ladder. Moomintroll scrambled over the window-sill and climbed cautiously down on his short legs. He could see Snufkin&#x2019;s footprints plainly in the wet earth, wandering here and there and rather difficult to follow, until suddenly they did a long jump and crossed over themselves. &#x201c;He must have been very happy,&#x201d; decided Moomintroll. &#x201c;He did a somersault here&#x2014;that&#x2019;s clear enough.&#x201d;<br>Suddenly Moomintroll lifted his nose and listened. Far away Snufkin was playing his gayest song, &#x201c;All small beasts should have bows in their tails.&#x201d; And Moomintroll began to run toward the music.<br>Down by the river he came upon Snufkin who was sitting on the bridge with his legs dangling over the water, his old hat pulled down over his ears.<br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; said Moomintroll sitting down beside him.<br>&#x201c;Hello to you,&#x201d; said Snufkin, and went on playing.<br>The sun was up now and shone straight into their eyes, making them blink. They sat swinging their legs over the running water feeling happy and carefree.<br>They had had many strange adventures on this river and had brought home many new friends. Moomintroll&#x2019;s mother and father always welcomed all their friends in the same quiet way, just adding another bed and putting another leaf in the dining-room table. And so Moomin house was rather full&#x2014;a place where everyone did what they liked and seldom worried about tomorrow. Very often unexpected and disturbing things used to happen, but nobody ever had time to be bored, and that is always a good thing.<br>When Snufkin came to the last verse of his spring song he put his mouth-organ in his pocket and said:<br>&#x201c;Is Sniff awake yet?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; answered Moomintroll. &#x201c;He always sleeps a week longer than the others.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then we must certainly wake him up,&#x201d; said Snufkin as he jumped down. &#x201c;We must do something special today because it&#x2019;s going to be fine.&#x201d;<br>So Moomintroll made their secret signal under Sniff&#x2019;s window: three ordinary whistles first and then a long one through his paws, and it meant: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something doing.&#x201d; They heard Sniff stop snoring, but nothing moved up above.<br>&#x201c;Once more,&#x201d; said Snufkin. And they signaled even louder than before.<br>Then the window banged up.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m asleep,&#x201d; shouted a cross voice.<br>&#x201c;Come on down and don&#x2019;t be angry,&#x201d; said Snufkin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to do something very special.&#x201d;<br>Then Sniff smoothed out his sleep-crinkled ears and clambered down the rope ladder. (I should perhaps mention that they had rope ladders under all the windows because it took so long to use the stairs.)<br>It certainly promised to be a fine day. Everywhere befuddled little creatures just woken from their long winter sleep poked about rediscovering old haunts, and busied themselves airing clothes, brushing out their moustaches and getting their houses ready for the spring.<br>Many were building new homes and I am afraid some were quarrelling. (You can wake up in a very bad temper after such a long sleep.)<br>The Spirits that haunted the trees sat combing their long hair, and on the north side of the tree trunks, baby mice dug tunnels amongst the snow-flakes.<br>&#x201c;Happy Spring!&#x201d; said an elderly Earthworm. &#x201c;And how was the winter with you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very nice, thank you,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. &#x201c;Did you sleep well, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; said the Worm. &#x201c;Remember me to your father and mother.&#x201d;<br>So they walked on, talking to a lot of people in this way, but the higher up the hill they went the less people there were, and at last they only saw one or two mother mice sniffing around and spring-cleaning.<br>It was wet everywhere.<br>&#x201c;Ugh&#x2014;how nasty,&#x201d; said Moomintroll, picking his way gingerly through the melting snow. &#x201c;So much snow is never good for a Moomin. Mother said so.&#x201d; And he sneezed.<br>&#x201c;Listen, Moomintroll,&#x201d; said Snufkin. &#x201c;I have an idea. What about going to the top of the mountain and making a pile of stones to show that we were the first to get there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, let&#x2019;s,&#x201d; said Sniff, and set off at once so as to get there before the others.<br>When they reached the top the March wind gambolled around them, and the blue distance lay at their feet. To the west was the sea; to the east the river looped round the Lonely Mountains; to the north the great forest spread its green carpet, and to the south the smoke rose from Moomintroll&#x2019;s chimney, for Moominmamma was cooking the breakfast. But Sniff saw none of these things because on the top of the mountain lay a hat&#x2014;a tall, black hat.<br>&#x201c;Someone has been here before!&#x201d; he said.<br>Moomintroll picked up the hat and looked at it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a rarey hat,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps it will fit you, Snufkin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; said Snufkin, who loved his old green hat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s much too new.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps father would like it,&#x201d; mused Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;Well, anyway we&#x2019;ll take it with us,&#x201d; said Sniff. &#x201c;But now I want to go home&#x2014;I&#x2019;m dying for some breakfast, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I should just say I am,&#x201d; said Snufkin.And that was how they found the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat and took it home with them, without guessing for one moment that this would cast a spell on the Valley of the Moomins, and that before long they would all see strange things...<br>When Moomintroll, Snufkin and Sniff went out onto the verandah the others had already had their breakfast and gone off in various directions. Moominpappa was alone reading the newspaper.<br>&#x201c;Well, well! So you have woken up, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remarkably little in the paper today. A stream burst its dam and swamped a lot of ants. All saved. The first cuckoo arrived in the valley at four o&#x2019;clock and then flew off to the east.&#x201d; (This is a good omen, but a cuckoo flying west is still better... )<br>&#x201c;Look what we&#x2019;ve found,&#x201d; interrupted Moomintroll, proudly. &#x201c;A beautiful new top hat for you!&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa put aside his paper and examined the hat very thoroughly. Then he put it on in front of the long mirror. It was rather too big for him&#x2014;in fact it nearly covered his eyes, and the effect was very curious.<br>&#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; screamed Moomintroll. &#x201c;Come and look at Father.&#x201d;Moominmamma opened the kitchen door and looked at him with amazement.<br>&#x201c;How do I look?&#x201d; asked Moominpappa.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Moominmamma. &#x201c;Yes, you look very handsome in it, but it&#x2019;s just a tiny bit too big.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it better like this?&#x201d; asked Moominpappa, pushing the hat on to the back of his head.<br>&#x201c;Hm,&#x201d; said Moominmamma. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s smart, too, but I almost think you look more dignified without a hat.&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa looked at himself in front, behind and from both sides, and then he put the hat on the table with a sigh.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some people look better without hats.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, dear,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, kindly. &#x201c;Now eat up your eggs, children, you need feeding up after living on pine needles all the winter.&#x201d; And she disappeared into the kitchen again.<br>&#x201c;But what shall we do with the hat?&#x201d; asked Sniff. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s such a fine one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Use it as a waste paper basket,&#x201d; said Moominpappa, and thereupon he took himself upstairs to go on writing his life story. (The heavy volume about his stormy youth.)<br>Snufkin put the hat down on the floor between the table and the kitchen door. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve got a new piece of furniture again,&#x201d; he said, grinning, for Snufkin could never understand why people liked to have things. He was quite happy wearing the old suit he had had since he was born (nobody knows when and where that happened), and the only possession he didn&#x2019;t give away was his mouth-organ.<br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve finished breakfast we&#x2019;ll go and see how the Snorks are getting on,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. But before going out into the garden he threw his eggshell into the wastepaper basket, for he was (sometimes) a well brought up Moomin.<br>The dining room was now empty.<br>In the corner between the table and the kitchen door stood the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat with the eggshell in the bottom. And then something really strange happened. The eggshell began to change its shape.<br>(This is what happens, you see. If something lies long enough in the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat it begins to change into something quite different&#x2014;what that will be you never know beforehand. It was lucky that the hat hadn&#x2019;t fitted Moominpappa because the-Protector-of-all-Small-Beasts knows what woul...</p></p><h2>Pre:Fab!</h2><p>Pre:Fab! is a memoir which tells the story of Colin Hanton&#39;s formative years up to and including his career with John Lennon&#39;s Quarry Men. Colin Hanton related his memories over a period of two years to Colin Hall and as a team they worked together to piece together Colin Hanton&#39;s fascinating story. As such it is an insight not only into Colin and John&#39;s early musical adventures but a vivid social history of war-time and post war Liverpool/ Britain. Colin was a Quarry Man when both Paul McCartney and George Harrison joined the group. Colin tells the story of these heady days and history-in-the-making days in this book. Colin Hanton and Colin Hall were both Liverpool born and bred. Colin Hanton was born in 1938 and became the drummer in John Lennon&#39;s very first group, The Quarry Men. He drummed for three years between 1956-1959, during which time Paul McCartney and George Harrison joined the band. In 1958 Colin Hanton played on the very first single that John, Paul and George ever recorded - their version of Buddy Holly&#39;s &#34;That&#39;ll Be The Day&#34; and a Paul McCartney and George Harrison tune, &#34;In Spite of All Danger&#34;, which happened to be the only song that Paul and George ever wrote together.</p><p>Colin Hall is a former and current resident of Woolton and the Wirral. He read Law at the University of Liverpool, graduating in 1970. For 14 years Colin Hall has been the custodian for `Mendips&#39;, John Lennon&#39;s former childhood home in Liverpool which is owned by the National Trust. It was donated to the Trust by Yoko Ono in 2003. Before this he managed rock musicians Sam Genders and Liam Bailey (who wrote and sang &#34;Blind Faith&#34; for Chase and Status, and was signed to Amy Winehouse&#39;s record label). For years Colin has written music features and reviews for R2 and before that What&#39;s On In London and Get Rhythm. Colin and his wife Sylvia (who is the custodian for Paul McCartney&#39;s former home) are currently Liverpool City Region `Tourism Stars of the Year, 2017&#39;. Colin was a lead member of Bob Harris&#39;s research team on his Sony Radio Award winning BBC Radio 2 documentary, &#34;The Day John Met Paul.&#34;</p><h2>Callus on My Soul: A Memoir</h2><p>Comedian and human rights activist Dick Gregory reflects on his life and modern American history in a conversational memoir.</p><p>Sheila Moses, a Rich Square, North Carolina playwright, poet, and biographer, is the author of One More River to Cross and So They Burned the Black Churches.Shelia P.

At a time when reinforced concrete and steel were considered industrial building materials, Wright boldly made use of them to build private homes. His prairie house concept&#x2014;that of a low, sprawling home based upon a simple L or T figure&#x2014;was the driving force behind some of his most famous houses and became a model for rural architecture across America. Wright`s designs for office and public buildings were equally groundbreaking and unique. From Fallingwater to New York`s Guggenheim Museum, his works are among the most famous in the history of architecture. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Architecture Series features:<ul> <li>an introduction to the life and work of the architect</li> <li>the major works in chronological order</li> <li>information about the clients, architectural preconditions as well as construction problems and resolutions</li> <li>a list of all the selected works and a map indicating the locations of the best and most famous buildings</li> <li>approximately 120 illustrations (photographs, sketches, drafts and plans)</li> </ul></p><p>Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer became Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s apprentice at the Taliesin Fellowship in 1949. In 1957, he attended the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris, returning in 1958 to continue his apprenticeship with Wright until his death in 1959. He remains at Taliesin to this day, as director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives, a vice-president of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, and author of numerous publications on Wright's life and work.&#34;A great architect is not made by a way of brain nearly so much as he is made by way of a cultivated, enriched heart.&#34; Frank Lloyd Wright&#34;</p><h2>Red star rising</h2><p>For 200 years there had been no peace on Pern - but now the signs were ominous.

Each turn reveals something new in a way that builds on the image on the previous page. Now that I&#x2019;m an illustrator myself, I&#x2019;ve often thought about this dramatic storytelling device and all of its creative possibilities. </p><p> My new book, <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>, is a 550 page novel in words and pictures. But unlike most novels, the images in my new book don't just illustrate the story; they help tell it. I've used the lessons I learned from Remy Charlip and other masters of the picture book to create something that is not a exactly a novel, not quite a picture book, not really a graphic novel, or a flip book or a movie, but a combination of all these things. </p><p> I began thinking about this book ten years ago after seeing some of the magical films of Georges M�li�s, the father of science-fiction movies. But it wasn&#x2019;t until I read a book called <i>Edison's Eve: The Quest for Mechanical Life</i> by Gaby Woods that my story began to come into focus. I discovered that M�li�s had a collection of mechanical, wind-up figures (called automata) that were donated to a museum, but which were later destroyed and thrown away. Instantly, I imagined a boy discovering these broken, rusty machines in the garbage, stealing one and attempting to fix it. At that moment, Hugo Cabret was born. </p><p> A few years ago, I had the honor of meeting Remy Charlip, and I'm proud to say that we've become friends. Last December he was asking me what I was working on, and as I was describing this book to him, I realized that Remy looks exactly like Georges M�li�s. I excitedly asked him to pose as the character in my book, and fortunately, he said yes. So every time you see M�li�s in <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>, the person you are really looking at is my dear friend Remy Charlip, who continues to inspire everyone who has the great pleasure of knowing him or seeing his work. </p><p> Paris in the 1930's, a thief, a broken machine, a strange girl, a mean old man, and the secrets that tie them all together... Welcome to <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>. </p><p> Yours, </p><p> Brian Selznick </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><b>Amazon.com Exclusive</b><br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Brian Selznick on a "Deleted Scene" from <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i></b><br><br>This is a finished drawing that I had to cut from <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>. I was still rewriting the book when I had to begin the final art. There was originally a scene in the story where this character, Etienne, is working in a camera shop. On one of my research trips to Paris I spent an entire day visiting old camera shops and photographing cameras from the 1930's and earlier, as well as the facades of the shops themselves. I researched original French camera posters and made sure that the counter and the shelves were accurate to the time period. I did all the drawings in the book at 1/4 scale, so they were very small and I often had to use a magnifying glass to help me see what I was drawing. After I finished this drawing I continued to rewrite, and for various reasons I realized that I needed to move this scene from the camera shop to the French Film Academy, which meant that I had to cut this picture. I tried really hard to find ANOTHER moment when I could have Etienne in a camera shop, but, as painful as it was, I knew the picture had to go. I'm glad to see it up on the Amazon website because otherwise no one would have ever seen all those tiny cameras I researched and drew so carefully! </p><p> <i>--Brian Selznick</i> </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <b>More from Brian Selznick</b> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br><i>The Houdini Box</i> </p></td> <td> <p><br><i>Walt Whitman: Words for America</i> </p></td> <td><br><i>The Boy of a Thousand Faces</i> </td></tr></tbody></table>Brian Selznick's books have garnered countless accolades worldwide, and have been translated into more than 35 languages.

Originating as a less-aggressive sister movement to punk, New Wave encompassed a wide range of styles, from Brit pub-rock to electronica, synth-pop, and even ska. <i>The Encyclopedia of New Wave</i> comprehensively captures this eclectic music, all of which enthralled the newly emergent MTV generation. With its tendency toward romantic minimalism, dark dance beats, and gender-bending antics, New Wave changed the course of popular musical history, as well as fashion and art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Bukszpan is a talented freelance journalist and music critic, but only a mediocre guitarist. He has written countless music reviews and feature articles for various newspapers, magazines, and online publications. Bukszpan is also the author of the best-selling <i>Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal</i>, with a foreword by Ronny James Dio. In his spare time, he performs heavy metal and occasionally produces records under his own label, Smoking in Bed Records. Bukszpan lives in New York City with his wife and son.*"This colorful and wildly entertaining look at the New Wave era in pop music (roughly, late 1970s through the end of the 1980s and defined within as &#x201c;a straightforward songwriting approach relying heavily on synthesizers and other electronic equipment&#x201d;) covers more than 150 artists and bands-from a-ha to Ze Popes. Best-selling acts such as Duran Duran, the Police, and the Smiths are included alongside one-hit wonders like the Flying Lizards, Kajagoogoo, and Q-Feel. Influential music-related personalities of the era, including Malcolm McClaren and Brian Eno, are also featured. A foreword by Gerald Casale, of the band Devo, and the introduction by the author serve to define New Wave and explain who was included as well as what was left out. Entries range from one column to three page spreads. The longer entries are made up of many photographs, with larger, well-known bands getting more coverage. The text is highly subjective and meant to be more for entertainment than research. A snarky-but amusing-tone is found throughout (e.g., 'Despite writing songs for uniformly despicable films, Go West has managed to keep a career going; In 1989, Cutting Crew released the appropriately named <i>The Scattering</i>, which sent record buyers running in all directions looking for somewhere-anywhere-to go in order to not buy it.' The eye-popping graphics-featuring a massive amount of photographs-will delight any fan of the music and the time period. Interesting sidebars are peppered throughout the text, such as 'Gender-Bending,' 'NY Clubs,' 'Heartthrobs,' 'Men's Fashion,' 'The Many Sounds of New Wave,' 'Music Videos,' 'Female Sex Symbols,' and 'Movies.' Appendixes include several 'Best of New Wave' lists, including 'Fifty Most Essential New Wave Singles,' 'Top Ten New Wave Bands with the Most Ridiculous Hair,' 'New Wave Timeline,' 'Ten Weirdest New Wave Singles,' and 'Top Twenty Essential New Wave Albums.' A bibliography and an index of artists and song titles round out the book..Cheeky yet incredibly informative, this is an inexpensive must-have for any music collection and will do especially well in circulation." --<i>Booklist</i> [STARRED REVIEW]&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Story, Song and Spirit: Fun and Creative Worship Services for All Ages</h2><p>These multigenerational worship services draw from folk tales, children&#39;s literature and everyday living.

The son of a slave, Murphy rose to the top of thoroughbred racing in a brilliant career that brought him wealth, honor and international fame. The first to win the Kentucky Derby three times (1884, 1890, 1891), Murphy won an unprecedented 44% of the races he entered. Part of the lore surrounding Murphy's legacy was his penchant for not using the whip. He preferred to ride his mounts into the winner's circle by using his well-honed skills and simply <i>talking</i> to his horses.<p> Through poetic imagination and historical research, Walker creates a unique literary portrait of Murphy. The poems are written in the voices of Murphy and his wife Lucy, his mentor African-American trainer Eli Jordan, and his parents James and America Burns. Their words follow Murphy's childhood years in Lexington, Kentucky, his rise to become America's most famous jockey, his encounters with racial violence in the post-Civil War South, and his early death at age thirty-five.</p><p> In Murphy's time, thoroughbred racing was dominated by African-American jockeys. In the first Kentucky Derby, thirteen of the fifteen jockeys were black. Of the first twenty-eight runnings of the Derby (1875-1902), fifteen were won by African-American riders. As the century ended, black jockeys began to disappear from racing, an exodus that continued throughout the twentieth century. <i>I Dedicate This Ride</i> helps bring this important history to light.</p><p> "I hope the knowledge of thoroughbred racing's original legacy can be returned to the African-American community and to all of us," says Walker. "I hope the book adds to the growing appreciation of Isaac Murphy as one of Kentucky's and the nation's greatest African-American figures. At the height of his career, Isaac was as famous as Jack Johnson, as fast as Jesse Owens, as dignified as Jackie Robinson and as admired as Michael Jordan. In Kentucky, he is to Lexington what Muhammad Ali is to Louisville."</p><p> The poems imagined/spoken here by Isaac and Lucy Murphy, Eli Jordan, and James and America Burns tell Murphy's compelling life story. They shine a light on the life of America's most celebrated black jockey, his family and community, and the historical canvas on which his extraordinary life played out.</p></p><p>Frank X Walker is a native of Danville, Kentucky, and the author of <i>Affrilachia</i> (2000), <i>Buffalo Dance</i> (2003), <i>Black Box</i> (2006), <i>When Winter Come</i> (2008) and <i>Isaac Murphy: I Dedicate This Ride</i> (2010). A founding member of the Affrilachian Poets, Walker created the word Affrilachia to make visible the black experience in the Appalachian South. He is Associate Professor of English at the University of Kentucky."Frank X Walker has turned in another brilliant performance, mounting history upon poetry for a thrilling ride." --Frederick Smock, <i>The Louisville Courier-Journal</i>, Oct. 9, 2010<br><br>"In <i>Isaac Murphy: I Dedicate This Ride</i> Frank X Walker helps restore to public memory one of history's greatest jockeys. Isaac Murphy's story has universal significance but it is very much a Kentucky story, of which all Kentuckians should be proud." --Gurney Norman, <i>Kentucky Poet Laureate</i><br><br>"The work of Frank X Walker is an eclectic, powerful mixture of liberating style, profound insight, and unwavering organic connection to the intellectual, political, and cultural struggles of a people. He stands in the tradition of DuBois, McKay, Robeson, Hughes, and other great writers, poets and performers whose contributions have transcended time and space to give generation after generation pause and hope." --Ricky L. Jones, author of <i>Black Haze</i></p><h2>Live Work Work Work Die: A Journey into the Savage Heart of Silicon Valley</h2><p><p><b>A scathing, sardonic exploration of Silicon Valley tech culture, laying bare the greed, hubris, and retrograde politics of an industry that aspires to radically transform society for its own benefit</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>At the height of the startup boom, journalist Corey Pein set out for Silicon Valley with little more than a smartphone and his wits. His goal: to learn how such an overhyped industry could possibly sustain itself as long as it has. But to truly understand the delirious reality of the tech entrepreneurs, he knew he would have to inhabit that perspective&#x2015;he would have to become an entrepreneur himself. Thus Pein begins his journey&#x2015;skulking through gimmicky tech conferences, pitching his over-the-top business ideas to investors, and rooming with a succession of naive upstart programmers whose entire lives are managed by their employers&#x2015;who work endlessly and obediently, never thinking to question their place in the system.</p><p>In showing us this frantic world, Pein challenges the positive, feel-good self-image that the tech tycoons have crafted&#x2015;as nerdy and benevolent creators of wealth and opportunity&#x2015;revealing their self-justifying views and their insidious visions for the future. Vivid and incisive, <i>Live Work Work Work Die</i> is a troubling portrait of a self-obsessed industry bent on imposing its disturbing visions on the rest of us.</p></p><p><p><b>Corey Pein</b> is an investigative reporter and a regular contributor to <i>The Baffler</i>.

Thompson&#x2019;s <i>Hell&#x2019;s Angels</i> in both style and conceit, <i>Live Work Work Work Die</i> is a combination of New Journalism and muckraking told with an anthropological eye. . . . Alternately amusing and horrifying.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<b><i>Salon</i></b></p><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Live Work Work Work Die</i> manages to capture something essential about Silicon Valley that has eluded other authors.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><br><p>&#x201c;Irreverent and snarky . . . A <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i> of the current tech boom, Pein&#x2019;s book is essential reading for anyone who thinks they might want to wade into tech&#x2019;s entrepreneurial waters. His sharp outsider observations of the San Francisco scene and ability to nose out the intellectual influences behind some of its biggest players make <i>Live Work Work Work Die</i> one of the most complete snapshots of the Silicon Valley today. <br>&#x2015;<b><i>National Post</i></b> (Canada)</p><br><p>&#x201c;Brisk and entertaining . . . funny and engaging . . . equal parts memoir, ethnography, reportage, and jeremiad.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></p><br><p>&#x201c;Pein is a rambunctious, motormouth writer . . .

A helluva ride.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<b>Joe Hagan</b>, author of <i>Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;All praise to Corey Pein for jumping headfirst into the cesspool of Silicon Valley and returning without having lost his mind or sold his soul. His reports from the front lines of the startup frenzy are hilarious and terrifying. While all eyes are glued on President Trump, a shortsighted and reactionary techno-oligarchy aims to amass a fortune at the cost of the common good. There&#x2019;s no app that can save us. But this book can at least wake us up to the dystopian future under construction.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b>Astra Taylor</b>, author of <i>The People&#x2019;s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;The Silicon Valley that Pein uncovers is not unlike dystopian visions we are accustomed to seeing in science fiction.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b><i>The New Republic</i></b></p><br><p>&#x201c;Pein&#x2019;s absurdly funny journey is a Through-the-Looking-Glass tale for the dying days of tech utopianism. Built on the creative vanity of this new class of talentless speculator and designed entirely without human need in mind, this world of nonsense quickly turns dystopian when seen from the perspective of a worker and renter trying to make his way through it.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<b>Angela Nagle</b>, author of <i>Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars From 4Chan And Tumblr To Trump And The Alt-Right</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;You sleep in a pantry because you can&#x2019;t afford a real apartment.

And you call it progress. Silicon Valley, the capitalist miracle. That is the American nightmare as Corey Pein brilliantly describes it, and it is not a work of the imagination.

Today psychotherapists throughout the world acknowledge that if women are to be able to love without possessing, to find work that fulfills them, and to discover their full sexuality, they must first acknowledge their identity as separate from their mother&#x2019;s. Nancy Friday&#x2019;s book played a major role in that acceptance. The greatest gift a good mother can give remains unquestioning love planted deep in the first year of life, so deep and anassailable that the tiny child grown to womanhood is never held back by the fear of losing that love, no matter what her own choice in love, sexuality, or work may be.<br><br>Through candid self-disclosure and hundreds of interviews, Friday investigates a generational legacy and reveals the conflicting feelings of anger, hate, and love the daughter&#x2019;s hold for their mothers&#x2013;and why they so often &#x201c;become&#x201d; that mother themselves.</p><p>Nancy Friday established herself as a magazine journalist in New York, England, Italy and France before turning to writing full time and publishing her first book, <i>My Secret Garden</i>, in 1973, which became a bestseller; Friday has regularly returned to the interview format in her subsequent books on themes ranging from mothers and daughters to sexual fantasies, relationships, jealousy, envy, feminism and beauty.<br><br>Her writings argue that women have often been reared under an ideal of womanhood which was outdated and restrictive, and largely unrepresentative of many women's true inner lives, and that openness about women's hidden lives could help free women to truly feel able to enjoy being themselves. She asserts that this is not due to deliberate malice, but due to social expectation, and that for women's and men's benefit alike it is healthier that both be able to be equally open, participatory and free to be accepted for who and what they are.</p><h2>Batman/Wildcat</h2><p>The fight of the century is on!

It'll take more than muscle if these two heroes want to try and shut down a secret superhuman fighting ring that's killing their combatants...and that&#x2019;s if they don&#x2019;t kill each other first! <br><br> Written by critically acclaimed author Chuck Dixon, this graphic novel pits Wildcat against two Gotham City greats--Batman and Catwoman!

His graphic novel adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i> is a perennial bestseller worldwide.

It contains four essays, including a moving memoir of his father&#39;s working life in the saw-mills of the Pacific Northwest, a tribute to his mentor John Gardner, and the title essay about the influences on his writing life; fifty poems, many of them not collected elsewhere; and, seven stories, including three from the early collection &#34;Furious Seasons&#34;.</p><p>Raymond Carver was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, in 1938. His first short stories appeared in Esquire during Gordon Lish&#39;s tenure as fiction editor in the 1970s. Carver&#39;s work began to reach a wider audience with the 1976 publication of Will You Please be Quiet, Please, but it was not until the 1981 publication of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love under Gordon Lish, then at Knopf, that he began to achieve real literary fame. This collection was edited by more than 40 per cent before publication, and Carver dedicated it to his fellow writer and future wife, Tess Gallagher, with the promise that he would one day republish his stories at full length. He went on to write two more collections of stories, Cathedral and Elephant, which moved away from the earlier minimalist style into a new expansiveness, as well as several collections of poetry. He died in 1988, aged fifty.&#34;Carver is a master; his stories are word perfect. His sentences stalk out meaning, following a trail of clues with patient care and painful anticipation. Fires [is] an indispensable volume and provides further proof of Carver&#39;s stature as a major American writer&#34; * New Statesman * &#34;These stories are perfect in pitch and tone.

The Muslim Scholars have agreed that all of the Ahadith in Sahih Muslim are authentic. Thus, Darussalam realized the great benefit of publishing the full version of Sahih Muslim in the English language in the best presentation. Much care has been taken in rendering these Ahadith into a clear and simple style of modern English.</p> <p>This fine-quality edition of Sahih Muslim has been verified by Dar-us-Salam Publications extensively. Its translation has been checked several times as not only to avoid mistranslating but also to avoid misinterpreting the ahadith as done by many translators of the current times in order to rush the product to market or to their lack of understanding of the Arabic language. Unlike other publishers which leave you wondering about the meaning of the ahadith, the unclear wording has been explained in the brackets. There are also footnotes on bottom of some of the pages, when the term cannot be explained in the brackets. This edition of Dar-us-Salam is nice in that it starts off by drawing a life sketch of Imam Muslim. Then, it goes on to the introduction of Sahih Muslim by Imam Muslim himself where he explains the difference between different narrators and level of trustworthiness.</p> <p>This edition is also different from other publishers in that the text is side by side with Arabic so you have access to both English and Arabic at the same time. Furthermore, the book regarding reporting from the trustworthy narrators have been placed first while other books follow it. Moreover, the Arabic text contains full chain of narrators while the English only mentions the companion. Lastly, in keeping with the tradition of high quality printing, this edition of Sahih Muslim by Dar-us-Salam Publications is second to none other &amp; made to last a long time, Insha Allah.</p></p><p><p>Imam Muslim is one of the foremost preservers of ahadith of the Prophet. His book comes second only to Sahih al Bukhari in terms of authenticity according to majority of scholars. It is considered to be better than Sahih Bukhari in terms of organization and repetition according to some scholars of Islam. It is the second in the collection of 6 books called 'Sihah Sittah' or '6 most authentic books'. Imam Muslim took painstaking efforts in preserving the words/actions/sayings and approvals of the Prophet. He has mostly used 4-5 narrators in the chain of transmission although there are a couple of hadith containing 3 narrators. Imam Muslim was a very good student of Imam Bukhari and some of his Shuyukhs, although he did not narrate from Imam Bukhari too much, thus reducing the # of narrators.</p></p><h2>Case of the Cottingley Fairies</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

As the titles of the first four parts in the volume&#x2015;&#x201c;The Return of Aristotle,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Legacy of Logical Positivism,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Inheritance of Pragmatism,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Essays after Wittgenstein&#x201d;&#x2015;suggest, many of the essays are concerned with tracing the recent, and the not so recent, history of these problems.</p><p>The goal is to bring out what is coercive and arbitrary about some of our present ways of posing the problems and what is of continuing interest in certain past approaches to them. Various supposedly timeless philosophical problems appear, on closer inspection, to change with altered historical circumstances, while there turns out to be much of permanent value in Aristotle&#x2019;s, Peirce&#x2019;s, Dewey&#x2019;s, and Reichenbach&#x2019;s work on some of the problems that continue to exercise us.</p><p>A unifying theme of the volume as a whole is that reductionism, scientism, and old-style disenchanted naturalism tend to be obstacles to philosophical progress. The titles of the final three parts of the volume&#x2015;&#x201c;Truth and Reference,&#x201d; &#x201c;Mind and Language,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Diversity of the Sciences&#x201d;&#x2015;indicate that the sweep of the problems considered here comprehends all the fundamental areas of contemporary analytic philosophy. Rich in detail, the book is also grand in scope, allowing us to trace the ongoing intellectual evolution of one of the most significant philosophers of the century.</p></p><p><p>Hilary Putnam was Cogan University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University.</p><p>James Conant is Chester D. Tripp Professor of Humanities at the University of Chicago.</p>&#x201c;The book strikes one...as fresh and exciting. This is undoubtedly due to its highly critical approach to current analytical philosophy. Analytical philosophy seems recently to have been overcome by the need to reflect on and challenge its past. Putnam has earned the right to hit out at that past if anyone has.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Max de Gaynesford</b><b>, </b><b><i>Radical Philosophy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Putnam is one of the foremost philosophers writing today and this volume collects many of his forays in current philosophical discourse.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Reader&#x2019;s Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Putnam has in mind the difference between respecting science and accepting materialist ideology.

In <em>God and Sex</em>, Coogan examines one of the most controversial aspects of the Hebrew Scripture: What the Old Testament really says about sex, and how contemporary understanding of those writings is frequently misunderstood or misrepresented. In the engaging and witty voice generations of students have appreciated, Coogan explores the language and social world of the Bible, showing how much innuendo and euphemism is at play, and illuminating the sexuality of biblical figures as well as God. By doing so, Coogan reveals the immense gap between popular use of Scripture and its original context. <em>God and Sex</em> is certain to provoke, entertain, and enlighten readers.<br></p><p><strong>Michael Coogan</strong> is Director of Publications for the Harvard Semitic Museum and Professor of Religious Studies at Stonehill College. For several decades, he has taught an introductory course on the Hebrew Scriptures at Harvard University, as well as at Wellesley College, Boston College, and Stonehill College. One of the leading biblical scholars in the United States, he is the author of <em>The Old Testament: A Historical and Literary Introduction to the Hebrew Scriptures</em>, and editor of the acclaimed third edition of <em>The New Oxford Annotated Bible</em>.Starred Review. Readers looking for an unbiased appraisal of what the Bible says about premarital sex, homosexuality, and polygamy can trust Coogan, a biblical scholar of the highest order. Concise, clear, and accessible to general readers, this book covers all the usual topics plus a few that may surprise. A professor of religious studies at Stonehill College and editor of the New Oxford Annotated Bible, Coogan has also taught at Harvard and Wellesley. He covers predictable ground in unpredictable ways, frankly noting, for example, the pervasive biblical assumption that women ar`e subordinate while explaining how that reflects the Bible's foreign and ancient context. The author does not overreach the evidence to promote his own agenda, but notes the Bible's contradictions on certain issues and admits the limits of modern scholarship. Readers may be surprised to find a convincing discussion of evidence for God's own (sometimes unflattering) sexuality, in metaphor if not in fact. Coogan's reminder at the book's end that modern application of biblical texts requires interpretation and nuance is a welcome corrective to selective, literalist use. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These short takes offer brilliant bursts of energy that are both dazzling and disappointing for their ephemeral nature. From "Two Doors," in which an old man is reminded of the moment in his youth when he accidently intruded on a half-dressed female relative, to "Anecdote," in which a woman isn't quite convinced that the man who failed to acknowledge her on the street is not her lover, Oates's focus is on moments of consciousness. In "Tick," a woman whose husband has left her is tranquil and self-sufficient, resisting "the temptation to succumb to thoughts of despair, self-hatred. Easier, she thinks, to hate yourself than to respect yourself; it involves less imagination." But when she discovers a tick embedded in her scalp she loses her independence to such a degree that she now longs for a reconciliation, and even a baby. As always, there is an edge to Oates's prose, and even when there is no central disturbance, the calm is uneasy, as though eruption may be imminent. Logical as daydreams, with endings similarly as interrupted or unforeseen, these stories reveal a master of the form writing at her efficient, full-tilt best. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.From the ever-prolific Oates comes a collection of very short stories of sad romance. Her characters, thoughtful and disturbed, are familiar figures to her fans, and even some of the very brief stories flash and sparkle. Too often, however, this collection seems to consist of literary exercises and cast-offs from would-be novels, fragments without a story to bind them together. Emotional, sexy, and bleak, these snippets tantalize but rarely amount to much. For comprehensive collections. Ann H.

Set in the volatile Paris summer of 1938, The Age of Reason follows two days in the life of Mathieu Delarue, a philosophy teacher, and his circle in the caf�s and bars of Montparnasse. Mathieu has so far managed to contain sex and personal freedom in conveniently separate compartments. But now he is in trouble, urgently trying to raise 4,000 francs to procure a safe abortion for his mistress, Marcelle. Beyond all this, filtering an uneasy light on his predicament, rises the distant threat of the coming of the Second World War. Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was an iconoclastic French philosopher, novelist, playwright and, widely regarded as the central figure in post-war European culture and political thinking. Sartre famously refused the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964 on the grounds that &#39;a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution&#39;. His most well-known works, all of which are published by Penguin, include The Age of Reason, Nausea and Iron in the Soul.

And that's when they discover that Tabby has a fish problem. . . . <br></p><p>Mr. Putter and his fine yellow cat, Tabby, both getting on in years, love going to the tropical fish store. Mr. Putter owned goldfish as a boy, and Tabby loves watching the fish because it makes "her whiskers tingle and her tail twitch." When the pair decides to bring home three fish one day, neither one of them is aware that, well, how shall we put it delicately... Tabby has a "fish problem." Each evening Tabby <i>wants</i> to go to bed, she <i>needs</i> to go to bed, but she can't drag herself away from the fishbowl. Day and night she finds herself batting the bowl, twitchy and dazed, in spite of Mr. Putter's gentle admonitions. After failed attempts to cover the bowl with a pillowcase and a bucket, Mr. Putter finally decides to find a new home for his goldfish and finds a willing beneficiary in his neighbor Mrs. Teaberry and her good dog, Zeke. Will Zeke turn out to have a fish problem too, or is this happily ever after for the goldfish?<p> Cynthia Rylant and Arthur Howard's series about the lovable Mr. Putter and his skittish cat, Tabby, is a terrific boon for early readers.

His mother, author Carol Bowman, could find no rational explanation for her son's behavior and decided to try an experimental procedure, allowing Chase to experience past life regression. She was shocked to hear her red-haired, freckle-faced son describe, in accurate detail, how he was an African American soldier who fought in the Civil War and died on the battlefields. He spoke of the rifles, of being wounded, of missing his wife and children, of wishing he had not volunteered to fight, of the loud sounds of shots ringing out incessant thunderous outbursts, and of dying. After Chase remembered this past life, his fear of loud noises utterly disappeared.<br>Chase's experience, and its beneficial outcome, led Bowman to begin research on children's past life memories. In this book, she offers the fascinating, startling, and truly incredible true stories of children who remember their past lives, including the experiences of her own son and daughter, and the past life regression she recalled herself. The book also offers advice to readers, illustrating how to detect clues to past life awareness, how to trigger past life memories, and how to use those memories to reap the full benefits of health and self-understanding for the child. Finally this is a book of inspiration that strongly supports a belief in reincarnation. Bowman demonstrates how the past influences the present, how we can learn to understand the realm of the spiritual, enter into that world to discover the immutable nature of the soul and explore the essence of life, death and the spaces in between.</p><p>Everyone I&#39;ve talked to about this book loved it as much as I did. While I was reading, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, not from fright, but from the emotional charge. It makes sense that children are likely to remember past lives as their open minds allow them to experience a trance state that adults have to practice to achieve, and maybe more children relive their former lives than we think. Carol Bowman gives us a guide for recognizing and handling such episodes. She writes not just as a researcher, but as a mother who has seen her own children go through the experience.<b>Carol Bowman</b>&nbsp;is an internationally known author, lecturer, past-life regression therapist, and pioneer in reincarnation studies.

Her two books,&nbsp;<i>Children&#x2019;s Past Lives</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Return from Heaven</i>, are considered classics in the field of reincarnation.</p><h2>Yeats: Romantic Visionary (Illustrated Poetry Anthology)</h2><p>Collects the works of the Irish poet, with a biographical introduction and a chronology</p><p></p><h2>Tales from the Medicine Trail: Tracking Down the Health Secrets of Shamans, Herbalists, Mystics, Yogis, and Other Healers</h2><p>A unique combination of adventure, anthropology, and advice on achieving natural health chronicles a quest to uncover the lost wisdom of healers, shamans and medicine men from a variety of cultures and offers information on natural remedies, including Macca, nature&#39;s Viagra. $100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>More than 5.1 billion people--85 percent of the world's population--depend on herbs as their primary medicines.

Two years and twenty thousand miles later, the result is <i>A Journey Through Literary America</i> -- a literary pilgrimage in photography and prose. In the words of one reviewer, "this is a beautiful and necessary book."<br>Through seven sections, ranging from New England's Early Leafs to The Inner Migration, from America's Main Streets to Twentieth Century Excursions, <i>A Journey Through Literary America</i> examines the facets of the American literary experience by combining captivating biographies, arresting images, hand drawn maps by Sinclair Lewis and William Faulkner, and the words of the authors themselves. Unique in its approach and invigorating in its outlook, this may be the book you never realized you needed.<br>The featured authors exhibit a range of voices: Sherwood Anderson * Raymond Carver * Willa Cather * James Fenimore Cooper * Rita Dove * Ralph Waldo Emerson * William Faulkner * Richard Ford * Robert Frost * Nathaniel Hawthorne * Ernest Hemingway * Langston Hughes * Washington Irving * Robinson Jeffers * Sinclair Lewis * Herman Melville * Henry Miller * Toni Morrison * Flannery O Connor * E. Annie Proulx * Philip Roth * Wallace Stegner * John Steinbeck * Henry David Thoreau * John Updike * Thomas Wolfe.</p><p>Thomas R. Hummel grew up in Burlington, Vermont and its environs. His parents, passing along their own lifelong passion, often spoke of and quoted literature to him and his three siblings. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in English and German literature from Middlebury College in 1990. He also has an MBA in International Business from George Washington University. For the past 13 years, he has been working at Toppan Printing Company, printers of art books and coffee table books.

Yet, much like other developing nations, the Chinese state now finds itself in a status quo characterized by free trade and American domination. Through a cutting-edge historical, sociological, and political analysis, Ho-fung Hung details the competing interests and economic realities that temper the dream of Chinese supremacy&#x2015;forces that are stymieing growth throughout the global South.<br><br>Hung focuses on four common misconceptions: that China could undermine orthodoxy by offering an alternative model of growth; that China is radically altering power relations between the East and the West; that China is capable of diminishing the global power of the United States; and that the Chinese economy would restore the world's wealth after the 2008 financial crisis. His work reveals how much China depends on the existing order and how the interests of the Chinese elites maintain these ties. Through its perpetuation of the dollar standard and its addiction to U.S. Treasury bonds, China remains bound to the terms of its own prosperity, and its economic practices of exploiting debt bubbles are destined to fail. Hung ultimately warns of a postmiracle China that will grow increasingly assertive in attitude while remaining constrained in capability.</p><p>Ho-fung Hung details the competing interests and economic realities that temper the dream of Chinese supremacy.

A woman must live her life as a woman, with a woman's values, or she fails. In <i>The Way Of Woman</i>, Luke drew from the riches of the Bible, mythology, folklore, Greek tragedies, and modern poetry to reconnect women with lost feminine images, symbols, and values. She speaks with the power of a true sage on continuity, relationships, the women's movement, marriage and divorce, and mothering. Profound, graceful, and transforming, <i>The Way Of Woman</i> is a true celebration of feminine worth.<p>Helen M. Luke (1904-95) was a&nbsp;writer, counselor, and Jungian therapist who shoed an extraordinary talent for applying religion, mythology, folklore, and literature to everyday life. She is the author of many books including, <i>Kaleidoscope</i>, <i>Dark Wood to White Rose</i>, <i>Old Age</i>, and <i>Woman: Earth and Spirit.</i></p></p><h2>No Nap for Benjamin Badger</h2><p>When Ben refuses to nap, Mother Badger tells him rhymes about all the animals that take naps until they both fall asleep.</p><p>PreSchool-K-- In this gentle, rhyming story, Benjamin Badger, who's going to be three, refuses to take a nap. His mother explains how other animals such as butterflies and grasshoppers rest. She continues to whisper verses as she tucks Ben into bed, and after he has finally fallen asleep, she indulges in a snooze herself. The rhyme is somewhat uneven, sounding forced at the end, but eloquent when the sleeping animals are described. Nolan's soft-toned watercolors with fine pen outlines complement the text. His illustrations of Ben and his cozy home make this an appealing book for young children, but they truly excel when he depicts the beauty of the natural world with its dozing dragonflies and blissful bullfrogs. A good choice to promote naptime, the book also provides an excellent, low-key introduction to the sublimity of nature. --Lori A.

She enjoys collecting old etiquette manuals, guidebooks to nineteenth-century London, and travelogues by intrepid Victorian women.Luck Be a Lady <br> <br>CHAPTER ONE<br> <br><br> <br>London, August 1886<br> <br>His name is William Pilcher,&#x201d; said Catherine&#x2019;s brother. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s no wonder if he stares. He has proposed to marry you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Catherine choked on her champagne. From her vantage point across the crowded room, William Pilcher made a very poor picture. It was not his looks to which she objected; he had a blandly handsome face, square and straight-boned, and a full head of brown hair. But he hunched in his seat with the gangly laxity of a scarecrow leaking its stuffing.<br> <br>That posture was probably intended to convey a fashionable insouciance. But it looked distinctly foolish on a man in his forties. Indeed, Mr. Pilcher&#x2019;s confidence annoyed her. At the beginning of the musicale, she had noticed how fixedly he gazed at her. That was not unusual; men often stared. But by the third aria, Pilcher&#x2019;s look had grown lecherous. Realizing now that he had finally caught her eye, he offered her a thin, twisting smile. He was congratulating himself, no doubt, on encouraging a spinster&#x2019;s dreams.<br> <br>Catherine snorted and turned to her brother. At last, she understood his mood tonight&#x2014;the high color on his face, the poorly restrained excitement. &#x201c;Peter.&#x201d; She spoke in an undertone, as the soprano launched into Verdi&#x2019;s &#x201c;O Patria Mia.&#x201d; &#x201c;For the final time. You will not choose my husband.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a matter of private regret that she resembled her brother so closely. The cross look that came into his face, and the temper that narrowed his lavender eyes, mirrored her own&#x2014;as did the fall of blond hair he brusquely hooked behind his ear. &#x201c;You make no effort to find one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And Mr. Pilcher is a fine choice. Assistant chairman in the St. Luke&#x2019;s vestry, with no small prospects. Besides, he has agreed to your terms.&#x201d;<br> <br>Astonished, she opened her mouth&#x2014;then thought better of it as the soprano descended into a low, soft note that provided no cover for arguments. Instead, she clutched her program very tightly and glared at the small type: &#x201c;An Evening of Musical Delights from Italy.&#x201d;<br> <br>For weeks now, ever since Catherine had broken her engagement to Lord Palmer, Peter had been harassing her to find a new suitor. He claimed to think of her happiness. She was nearly twenty-seven, he pointed out. If she did not marry this year, she would remain a spinster. By the terms of Father&#x2019;s will, you cannot assume equal governance in the company until you are wed. Isn&#x2019;t that your wish?<br> <br>But her happiness did not truly concern him&#x2014;much less the power she might gain, once she married and became his full partner at Everleigh&#x2019;s. What he wanted was to marry her to some man who would forbid her to work at all. Then, Peter would have free rein to loot the place. He was already embezzling from the company to fund his political ambitions. He imagined she didn&#x2019;t notice, that her attention was swallowed wholesale by her duties. But he was wrong.<br> <br>And now he&#x2019;d solicited a stranger to accept her terms? He could only mean the marriage contract she had drawn up with Lord Palmer. But that had been the product of a different moment: Palmer had needed her aid in drawing out a villain, and she, having just discovered Peter&#x2019;s embezzlement, had felt desperate for a powerful ally who might force her brother into line.<br> <br>In the end, fate had saved her from the rash plan to marry. Palmer had fallen in love with her assistant, Lilah. Their elopement had left Catherine feeling nothing but relief. She did not want a loveless marriage&#x2014;or any marriage at all. It was not in her nature to be a wife: to subordinate her own desires and needs to a man&#x2019;s, and to knit patiently by the fire in expectation of his return from the office. She had her own office, her own work, and a gentleman would never allow that. Better to muddle on independently, then, and find some other way to stem Peter&#x2019;s thieving.<br> <br>But how? Unless she married, she had no authority to challenge him.<br> <br>The aria soared to a crescendo. Peter took the opportunity to speak into her ear. &#x201c;Only say the word. The contract is signed, the license easily acquired.&#x201d;<br> <br>She snorted. &#x201c;Lovely. I wish him luck in finding a bride.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Catherine&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The sharpness of his voice drew several looks from those nearby. Pasting a smile onto her lips, she rose and walked out of the salon.<br> <br>In the hallway, Peter caught up to her, his hand closing on her arm. She pulled away and faced him, still careful to smile, mindful of the guests chatting in an adjoining drawing room. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the place to discuss this.&#x201d;<br> <br>He raked his fingers through his blond hair, then winced and smoothed it down again. Always the peacock, ever mindful of his appearance. &#x201c;At least meet him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She should have known something was awry when he pleaded so sweetly for her to accompany him tonight. Like husbands, polite society had little use for women who worked. Nor was this crowd known to her from the auction house, for it represented the second tier of political and social lights in London&#x2014;those who aspired to bid at Everleigh&#x2019;s but lacked the funds to merit an invitation. The truly rich were summering abroad, or had gone to their country homes for hunting season.<br> <br>Peter, on the other hand, had every reason to associate with this lot. He nursed dreams of a political career. He had managed to gain a seat on the Municipal Board of Works, but such power meant nothing outside London. Among these minor MPs and political cronies, he hoped to lay the groundwork for his future.<br> <br>The family business had never held his interest. He was looting it in service of his true ambitions. But for her, Everleigh&#x2019;s was everything. Their father&#x2019;s legacy. Her sacred birthright. Everleigh&#x2019;s made her who she was&#x2014;which was not merely a spinster, the &#x201c;Ice Queen&#x201d; that rude wits had dubbed her. She was a person of business. An expert in the field of fine arts. A learned professional, regardless of her sex.<br> <br>And she was done looking for common ground with her brother. &#x201c;I am leaving,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;Fetch my coat, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will meet him.&#x201d;<br> <br>She started toward the cloakroom. He caught her wrist, his grip bruising now. &#x201c;Listen carefully, Catherine. I have practiced patience with you. But you have mistaken it for indulgence. I have given my word to Mr. Pilcher that you will&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It will not help your prospects to be seen abusing me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter&#x2019;s hand fell away. Far better to quarrel with him in public than in private, in this regard.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have given your word,&#x201d; she said in a fierce �undertone. &#x201c;Not me. When he asks where I have gone, simply explain to him the arrogance of your presumption&#x2014;if indeed you can explain it. For it is perfectly incredible.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter took a breath through clenched teeth. &#x201c;If you won&#x2019;t think of yourself, then think of Everleigh&#x2019;s. Don&#x2019;t you wish for children to carry forward the company? What is the future of the auction rooms, if not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop it.&#x201d; Anger made her hands fist. If Peter had his way, there would be no auction house for her fictional children to inherit. He was trying to tap into the principal now. Did he truly think Mr. Wattier, their chief accountant, would not have informed her of that attempt?<br> <br>But she could not confront him before she had devised a way to check him. She had sworn Mr. Wattier to secrecy, for surprise was the only advantage she �possessed right now. &#x201c;Think of your own children. Find yourself a spouse. But you will leave me be.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think of your welfare,&#x201d; he said flatly. &#x201c;If you do not wish to find yourself homeless and penniless one day, you must marry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now he was speaking nonsense. &#x201c;I am far from penniless. I will remind you that half of Everleigh&#x2019;s belongs to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>His smile made her uneasy, for it smacked of some secret satisfaction. &#x201c;But you are not a partner in its directorship,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not until you are married.&#x201d;<br> <br>That fact never failed to burn her. No doubt Papa had anticipated that she would marry long before the age of twenty-six. But he should have foreseen that Peter would abuse the authority granted to him in the interim.<br> <br>What she needed, Catherine thought bitterly, was a puppet husband&#x2014;somebody she could control, or somebody so indifferent that he permitted her to do as she pleased. But Mr. Pilcher would not suit. He was Peter&#x2019;s creature. What she needed was a creature all her own. &#x201c;Regardless,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your threats hold no water.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have made no threats,&#x201d; Peter said softly. &#x201c;But I will tell you a fact. If you do not marry, you leave me no choice but to safeguard your future through other means.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stared at him. &#x201c;What means that, precisely?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. &#x201c;I have been thinking of selling the auction rooms.&#x201d;<br> <br>The breath escaped her in a hoarse gasp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Naturally,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;half the profits would go to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Had he struck her, here in public, he could not have stunned her more completely. &#x201c;You . . . you&#x2019;re lying. This is a ruse to make me entertain Mr. Pilcher.&#x201d;<br> <br>As though her words had summoned him, the scarecrow came into the hall. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; Pilcher manufactured a look of surprise. &#x201c;Mr. Everleigh, how good to find you here tonight. And this lovely lady must be&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I fear I am no one to you, sir.&#x201d; Catherine kept her eyes on her brother, who must be bluffing. But he looked so pleased with himself. Rage roughened her voice. &#x201c;My brother, however, has an apology to make.&#x201d; She inclined her head the slightest degree to Pilcher&#x2014;the only courtesy she could bring herself to pay him&#x2014;then turned on her heel for the cloakroom.<br> <br>Peter&#x2019;s voice reached her as she rounded the corner. &#x201c;She is shy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Only give me a little time to persuade her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For such a vision,&#x201d; said the scarecrow, &#x201c;I will gladly grant as much time as it requires.&#x201d;<br> <br>A chill went through her, followed by a surge of panic. She needed a method to deter Peter from this mad course. There was no time to waste.<br> <br>An idea seized her. Perfect madness&#x2014;but what other recourse did she have? She knew just the man to bring Peter to heel. All it would require of her was a great deal of money . . . and a reckless disregard for decency and the law.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Sad sight, to see a grown man weep.&#x201d; Nicholas O&#x2019;Shea lifted away his blade, then motioned to his man by the door.<br> <br>Johnson hurried over with the flask. Alas, a single mouthful of ale wasn&#x2019;t going to wash this bitter taste from Nick&#x2019;s mouth. Nasty work, torturing a pig. He tipped back the flagon, drinking long and deep. Would have drained it to the dregs, had a single word not interrupted him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>He lowered the flask. &#x201c;Please, what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll thell &#x2019;oo. Honeshly, I will!&#x201d;<br> <br>There was all he&#x2019;d been wanting: a spot of truth amid the lies. He handed the flask back to Johnson, then crouched down.<br> <br>The man on the floor was called Dixon. He&#x2019;d looked much prettier two hours ago, very spiffy with his fine wool trousers flapping at his ankles. Nick had interrupted him in the middle of a poke-and-cuddle with a girl barely old enough to sport a bosom. Why did swine always have a taste for children? It never failed to baffle him, these patterns to which evil so regularly inclined.<br> <br>But they were handy in their own way. Kept his conscience from troubling him now as he yanked up the bastard&#x2019;s head, and saw what his own fists had wrought. Dixon&#x2019;s face wasn&#x2019;t pretty any longer. No more little girls for him. Now they would spot him at first glance for a monster. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be needing dentures to eat,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll spot you the coin, if you make this quick.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dixon sniveled. There was no other word for the way his face crumpled, nor the sound that came from his bloody, foaming mouth. &#x201c;Jes&#x2019; know &#x2019;afore I tell you, sir. The buildings, they weren&#x2019;t safe! I was within my rights to condemn them!&#x201d;<br> <br>Scoffing, Nick sat back on his heels. Here was the greatest lie yet. &#x201c;You idiot. You haven&#x2019;t put it together yet. Those properties are in Whitechapel. I own them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Dixon blinked. &#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tricky things, parish borders. Whitechapel&#x2019;s poke like&#x201d;&#x2014;he jammed his finger into Dixon&#x2019;s forehead&#x2014;&#x201c;this into St. Luke&#x2019;s. Those neighboring lots aren&#x2019;t mine. But the two buildings you condemned, they&#x2019;re out of your jurisdiction. Whitechapel&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dixon&#x2019;s jaw sagged. He looked properly sick now. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Nick finished. He&#x2019;d imagined as much. For three years, Dixon had been trotting about the edge of Nick&#x2019;s territories, exercising his authority under the Torrens and Cross Acts to condemn hazardous buildings.<br> <br>Speculators liked nothing better than those acts, for they gave a man a chance to buy property on the cheap. The law required the new owners to replace the condemned buildings with decent housing for the poor. But speculators rarely followed through on that part. What buildings they constructed charged rents no ordinary man could afford. Thanks to Dixon, the displaced had been flooding into Nick&#x2019;s territory, placing a mighty strain on the parish of Whitechapel.<br> <br>Still, Nick might have tolerated it, had Dixon&#x2019;s work remained honest. Recently, however, Dixon had taken to condemning buildings that were perfectly sound. Peculiar business for a surveyor. Downright irritating when the properties he condemned belonged to Nick.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will ask you one last time,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;Who paid you to condemn them? And no more rubbish about a corporation. There&#x2019;s a man behind it, and I&#x2019;ll have his name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll . . .&#x201d; Dixon swallowed. &#x201c;Look here, sir&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll go to the board. I&#x2019;ll explain the mistake, tell them that I didn&#x2019;t realize&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somebody realized,&#x201d; Nick said flatly. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll have his name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll kill me for telling you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Probably so. &#x201c;Got to watch who you mix with in the future.&#x201d; He raised his knife again. &#x201c;Assuming you&#x2019;ve got one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dixon began to cry, big, fat tears that mixed with his bloody snot. &#x201c;William Pilcher.&#x201d;<br> <br>The name rang a bell. &#x201c;St. Luke&#x2019;s man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Dixon said. &#x201c;And . . . he&#x2019;s the vestry representative to the Municipal Board of Works.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brilliant. The very board that approved petitions under the Torrens and Cross Acts.<br> <br>Nick snorted as he rose to his full height. Corruption was a rich man&#x2019;s game, with the poor always paying the price for it.<br> <br>Dixon grabbed his ankles. &#x201c;Please, sir, I&#x2019;ll do anything. Only protect me from him! I promise, I&#x2019;ll serve you well&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick kicked free. &#x201c;This is Whitechapel, lad.

Railroads helped to define the character of America, and that certainly was the case in Iowa.

Raised by her ambitious grandmother, the regal and commanding Paulina del Valle, she grows up in a privileged environment, free of the limitations that circumscribe the lives of women at that time, but tormented by horrible nightmares. When she is forced to recognize her betrayal at the hands of the man she loves, and to cope with the resulting solitude, she decides to explore the mystery of her past. </p><p><em>Portrait in Sepia</em> is an extraordinary achievement: richly detailed, epic in scope, intimate in its probing of human character, and thrilling in the way it illuminates the complexity of family ties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Isabel Allende has established herself as one of the most consummate of all modern storytellers, a reputation that is confirmed in her novel <i>Portrait in Sepia</i>. Allende offers a compelling saga of the turbulent history, lives, and loves of late 19th-century Chile, drawing on characters from her earlier novels, <i>The House of Spirits</i> and <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>.<p> In typical Allende fashion, <i>Portrait in Sepia</i> is crammed with love, desire, tragedy, and dark family secrets, all played out against the dramatic backdrop of revolutionary Chile. Our heroine Aurora del Valle's mother is a Chilean-Chinese beauty, while her father is a dissolute scion of the wealthy and powerful del Valle family. At the heart of Aurora's slow, painful re-creation of her childhood towers one of Allende's greatest fictional creations, the heroine's grandmother, Paulina del Valle. An "astute, bewigged Amazon with a gluttonous appetite," Paulina holds both the del Valle family and Allende's novel together as she presides over Aurora's adolescence in a haze of pastries, taffeta, and overweening love.</p><p> One of the most interesting aspects of the novel is Allende's decision to turn her heroine into a photographer: "through photography and the written word I try desperately to conquer the transitory nature of my existence, to trap moments before they evanesce, to untangle the confusion of my past." There is little confusion in Allende's elegantly crafted and hugely enjoyable novel. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>In nineteenth-century Chile, Aurora del Valle suffers a brutal trauma that erases all recollections of the first five years of her life.

This travelogue is considered by many modern travel writers to be the first example of great travel writing. Bruce Chatwin has described it as &#x201c;a sacred text, beyond criticism&#x201d; and carried his copy since he was fifteen years old, &#x201c;spineless and floodstained&#x201d; after four journeys through central Asia. By the Si-o-seh pol bridge in Isfahan, Iran, Byron wrote: &#x201c;The lights came out. A little breeze stirred, and for the first time in four months I felt a wind that had no chill in it. I smelt the spring, and the rising sap. One of those rare moments of absolute peace, when the body is loose, the mind asks no questions, and the world is a triumph, was mine.&#x201d;</p><p>Robert Byron (26 February 1905 &#x2013; 24 February 1941) was a British travel writer, art critic and historian. Byron traveled to widely different places; Mount Athos, India, the Soviet Union, and Tibet. However it was in Persia and Afghanistan that he found the subject round which he forged his style of modern travel writing, when he later came to write up his account of "The Road to Oxiana" in early 1936, in Beijing, when he found himself alone in house of Desmond Parsons, the unreciprocated love of his life. Robert Byron died in 1941, during the Second World War, when the ship on which he was travelling was torpedoed by a U-Boat off Cape Wrath, Scotland, en route to Egypt. His body was never found.</p><h2>A River Runs Through It: Bringing a Classic to the Screen</h2><p>The screenplay for the film is accompanied by the screenwriter&#39;s comments on the difficulty in adapting the story</p><p></p><h2>Invisible Contracts</h2><p>One of the reasons why lawyers try and raise numerous subclassifications of Tort up to the main level of Tort and Contract (as they grope and search in the dark the way they do), is because they do not see the invisible contracts that are often quietly in effect, correctly overruling Tort Law intervention, since an examination of the factual setting seems void of any contract. By the end of this Letter, you will see many invisible contracts for what they really are, and you will see how to identify the indicia that create invisible contracts. <p>You may not understand the deeper significance of the distinction in effect between Tort and Contract right now, but after reading this through a few times, the semantic differential in meaning should become very apparent to you, as I will give many examples of Contract Law and Tort Law reasonings and arguments, as applied across many different factual settings; as whenever there is a judgment of some type, there is always in effect some rules and an exclusion of some evidence in the mind of the judge as to what arguments will and will not be allowed to be heard -- (even though this process goes on unmentioned orally by the judge); and the real reason why there is an important significance here that you might be interested in taking Personal Notice of [just like Judges take Judicial Notice of special items], in Tort and Contract rule differentials in judgment settings, is because we all have an impending Judgment with Heavenly Father -- where arguments then presented will be judged under similar Tort and Contract rules; a judgment setting where the pure magnitude of the consequences renders unprepared incorrect reasoning injudicious and lacking in foresight.</p></p><p></p><h2>Pie Every Day: Recipes and Slices of Life</h2><p>PIE EVERY DAY will convince even beginning cooks that, with very little fuss or trouble, delicious, filling, nutritious pies can indeed be offered up at the family table every day.

It relieves the outcome of being important&nbsp;to bestow the highest significance to the exact moment at hand, when nothing else matters. That focus quiets&nbsp;the mind, initiates stillness, and opens up every facet of one's being in order to lock in and ignite the potential just waiting to be catalyzed moment by moment. When past and future disappear, and winning and losing are forgotten, competition subsides, leaving the only possibility that anything is possible.</p><p><b>Mark Allen</b> is a&nbsp;six-time Hawaii Ironman Triathlon World Champion.

When she finally put them to paper, her book &#34;Jaffna Cookery&#34; became one of the few compilations of authentic Jaffna recipes, and a compendium of the tastes of her childhood. Coconut and palmyrah make many an appearance, but so do drumsticks and eggplant. Jaffna cuisine is above all famous for its use of the fresh seafood that abounds along those coasts. The soup known as Kool is among the region&#39;s signature dishes. &#34;Everyone likes it,&#34; says Mrs. Somasekaram, explaining that the dish is a meal in itself. Its unique flavour results from a slew of mouth watering ingredients. Crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns and crayfish create a seafood broth into which Mrs. Somasekaram adds long beans, jak seeds, manioc and spinach. With hints of tamarind, the entire dish is thickened with the help of palmyrah root flour. Mrs. Somasekaram&#39;s book includes pictures of some signature dishes. In a layout for lunch, red rice accompanies a set of curries that appear to conform to the standard rice and curry menu that is so common across the island.

In his reinterpretation of "winning" the West, Drinnon links racism with colonialism and traces this interrelationship from the Pequot War in New England, through American expansion westward to the Pacific, and beyond to the Phillippines and Vietnam. He cites parrallels between the slaughter of bison on the Great Plains and the defoliation of Vietnam and notes similarities in the language of aggression used in the American West, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Drinnon</b> was Professor Emeritus of History at Bucknell University and the author of <i>White Savage: The Case of John Dunn Hunter</i> and <i>Keeper of Concentration Camps: Dillon S.

This time it's a dog, which he spies begging in the town square one market day. The story of how the little stray finds a home with a sympathetic policeman and his family tugs at the heartstrings as only a Herriot tale can--and in all fairness, should probably carry a warning label for parents who have steadfastly resisted their child's pleas for a pet.

With this new title from Arcane Wisdom Press we have a book-length sequence of semi-interconnected pieces, all of which are inspired by H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s superb sonnet sequence, FUNGI FROM YUGGOTH. Each numbered segment is an imaginative response to that numbered sonnet in Lovecraft&#39;s sequence, and Pugmire&#39;s Lovecraftian influence is the main force that drives this present work; yet other influences burrow from his fevered brain - Oscar Wilde, Edgar A. Poe, Baudelaire and the Decadents. Like some freakish soul who has lost his place in modern time, Pugmire&#39;s style is like that from another era, and yet it too is tainted by his neoteric experience as a punk rock queen and street transvestite. Like his literary heroes such as H. P. Lovecraft and Thomas Ligotti and Henry James, Pugmire strives to create what he does not hesitate to call &#34;literary art&#34; - prose pieces that are beautifully poetic and imaginatively deranged. This perverse concoction is best when sipped slowly, occasionally, and this is not a book to rush through in one sitting. Let it plant its poisoned fungi gradually upon your innocent brain, and thus blemish forever your paltry soul.</p><p></p><h2>Read Thread: The Story of the Red Thread (Sternberg Press)</h2><p><p>From the 1970s to the present, Cecilia Vicu�a's work has both visually and poetically engaged with rituals from Aboriginal Australia, South Africa, Paleolithic Europe, and pre-Columbian America that involve red-colored thread. The Chilean artist's performances, site-specific installations, paintings, and drawings relate to the symbolic function of textile and language as well as the ritual dimension of menstrual blood in the construction of solidarity through femininity and maternity, to support and continue life. </p><p>Appearing on the occasion of Vicu�a's installation in Athens for documenta 14, <i>Read Thread</i> tells the story of the sanguine thread in Vicu�a's work. A tension arises in the asymmetry of Andean weaving and the artist's <i>quipus</i>&#x2015;large-scale immersive installations of thread, wool, and yarn that reference the pre-Columbian language of knotting, a type of weaving-as-writing. Vicu�a's translation of the <i>quipu</i> into a spatial and performative poetics conveys the tension of ecological disaster and reparation as well as a bodily sense of the cosmic scale of landscape, history, and time. </p><p>Alongside documentation of Vicu�a's <i>quipus</i>, this publication includes hybrid compositions&#x2015;poetic texts and narratives&#x2015;written by the artist especially for this project, often relating the works to their political and historical context.

Jean Plaidy&#39;s novels had sold more than 14 million copies worldwide by the time of her death in 1993.In the third part of Plaidy&#39;s Katharine of Aragon trilogy, Anne Flosnik&#39;s soothing voice takes the listener back to the end of her reign. The king&#39;s secret matter, his attempt to obtain a divorce from his longtime wife so he can make Anne Boleyn his queen, comes to light, and court intrigue ensues. The story&#39;s frequent changes of scene and point of view would be difficult to follow on audio were it not for Flosnik&#39;s ability to move seamlessly between the characters, underscoring their most diverse qualities. In particular, she adds a slight oiliness to the voice of Cardinal Wolsey, who is determined to do anything to serve his king, and a foreign accent to the voice of Katharine, which shows how out of place she is in her shifting world.

They use short declarative statements. Capital letters. Red ink. Some points are underlined. In summation: they want everything. It is the end. Dylan uses nail scissors to trim the longest stragglers on his beard, he bends over a row of sinks in the ladies&#x2019; and splashes water on his face. He has acted out many roles in front of these mirrors: Jedi, Goonie, zombie, vengeful telekinetic teen&#x2014;a Soho kid growing up in an art-house cinema: he&#x2019;d lie onstage in his pajamas watching stars glide across the ceiling for hours.

The ticket stall is musty. A trail of empty gin glasses leads to his projection booth. He briefly recalls toasting Tom and Jerry, Man Ray, Herzog and Lynch, Besson and Bergman, the girls from the peep show next door, Hansel, Gretel and all of their friends. He picks up the letter again. Even if she had told him, he couldn&#x2019;t have done anything. The account is empty. There is less than nothing. The deficit has so many figures he quit counting. A pile of unpaid bills are stacked neatly in Vivienne&#x2019;s vintage sewing box and when he got back from the crematorium he found an envelope containing the deeds for a caravan 578.3 miles away, with a pink Post-it note and her scrawl: Bought for cash&#x2014;no record in any of our accounts.

A stack of records next to Gunn&#x2019;s gramophone have still not been put back in their sleeves. Their cigarette ends (or Vivienne&#x2019;s at least) are still in the ashtray.

They are gnarly, violent-looking Serbians&#x2014;if he had a cat they&#x2019;d likely behead the thing, spike its head on the gates of the city so it could grin at passersby.<br><br>London is not lined with lollipops.<br><br>Businesses are closing&#x2014;everywhere.<br><br>He should: take the keys to the bailiffs immediately. This is written in red capital letters. That&#x2019;s not going to happen. If they want his family&#x2019;s home then they can break in. He&#x2019;s not handing it to them. Banks are doing this up and down the country; any hint of weakness (which they generate by wrecking the economy) and they swoop in, put great big metal shutters right across the doors, do it up and sell it for a profit. They&#x2019;ll make a bomb. In all truth, he can&#x2019;t be in this cinema without his mother and grandmother. This was their place. Everywhere he looks another part of him hurts.<br><br>Nobody told him grief would be so physical.<br><br>Adrenaline.<br><br>Sitting down.<br><br>Each muscle aching like he has been beaten from head to toe. Grief is in his marrow. It is in his brain. It has even slowed the way he washes his hands. Dylan enters their only auditorium and presses a button on the wall. Red curtains whirr toward each other, they trail across the stage like a dancer&#x2019;s ballgown in an old film, and he turns on star lights so they glide across the ceiling. He will leave Cinema 1 like this. It&#x2019;s only right. For the first time in over sixty years there will not be a MacRae in ownership at 345a Fat Boy Lane, Soho. Babylon (the smallest art-house cinema in all of Europe) will no longer glow from the foyer chandelier as people hurry by in the rain.<br><br>Dylan pulls on socks, boots, grabs a scarf.<br><br>He packs Vivienne&#x2019;s old suitcase.<br><br>Art-deco ashtrays.<br><br>Clothes.<br><br>Two cinema reels.<br><br>The urns are on the popcorn stand and he tries to fit them into the suitcase but it won&#x2019;t close. He begins to sweat and rummages behind the counter for a plastic bag but there aren&#x2019;t any. He yanks open cupboards and the box-office till, he looks in the bin, wrenches open the dishwasher&#x2014;there is an old ice cream tub and a Tupperware container.<br><br>He takes them out.<br><br>Places the urns on the counter.<br><br>Gunn should go in the ice cream tub. It&#x2019;s bigger. Not that she is likely to have more ashes but she would be less bothered about being in an ice cream tub than Vivienne. Vivienne would be mighty fucking pissed off about traveling anywhere in an ice cream tub. His grandmother wouldn&#x2019;t give much of a shit. Dylan wishes (not for the first time today) that he had drunk a little less last night. He picks up one urn, then puts it back down again, beginning slightly to panic. He unscrews Gunn&#x2019;s urn and tips the ashes into the ice cream tub. Some fall onto the floor and he automatically rubs at them with his boot, then looks up and mouths the word Sorry. He lobs that empty urn into the sink and unscrews the other one. He tips Vivienne into the Tupperware container but it fills to the brim too quickly&#x2014;he can&#x2019;t fit all of her ashes in there.<br><br>&#x2014;Fuck&#x2019;s sake!<br><br>Dylan slams drawers and finds a spoon and carefully pats his mother&#x2019;s ashes down until there is a half inch of space on top. They have to fit in. He can&#x2019;t take her in two different containers. It wouldn&#x2019;t be right and anyway there&#x2019;s only popcorn boxes left and they have no lids! His hands are shaky. He is too hungover for this shit. He needs sugar. Coffee. A wank. More sleep. None of these things are going to happen. He pours in the rest of his mother&#x2019;s ashes and pats them down, pours the last bit and smoothes them down as well; a cold slick of sweat trickles right down his back as he tries to snap on the lid. He never could get Tupperware container lids on easily. It&#x2019;s a skill he doesn&#x2019;t possess.<br><br>&#x2014;What&#x2019;s the fucking deal with this bollocks!<br><br>The roaring and shaking his fist and stamping his feet doesn&#x2019;t help, so he stands on it and the Tupperware lid clicks. He gets a bit of gaffer tape and wraps it around just to make sure. He picks them up. What if he forgets which one is which? He could text himself a note: Grandma&#x2019;s in the ice cream tub, Mum&#x2019;s in the sandwich box. Instead he rummages around until he finds a roll of stickers and uses a ballpoint to scrawl Gunn on one, then Vivienne with a smiley face on another. Sometimes he has no idea how he made it to thirty-eight. He is always running late, for a start, as if time is the main problem in his life. It seems pretty much all the things people are supposed to have done by his age have passed him by, while he did nothing but develop an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure cinema and the rudimentary skills of distilling gin.<br><br>That was fine when he was helping to keep the family business afloat.<br><br>It&#x2019;s unlikely to impress the job center.<br><br>Dylan places the containers side by side. They fit neatly into the suitcase now&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not the most elegant way to take his mum and grandma back to their homeland but it will do the job. He places a photograph of Gunn, Vivienne and himself as a baby on top and clicks the suitcase shut. Dylan reassures himself that this must be the worst hangover he has ever had in his life and his brain will return to optimum (average) functioning by tomorrow, or the day after at a push. He has at least twelve hours to be vacant on the megabus journey. That thought is soothing. Although the megabus is no doubt a shit-fest of body odor and claustrophobia and every bit of public transport is overcrowded with people panicking, but not so many will be going north like him. There is a hard knot of muscle in his shoulder. He looks for a piece of A4 paper but there isn&#x2019;t any in the printer, so he grabs a flyer: Les Fran�ais vus par (The French as Seen By . . .), 13 minutes long, W. Herzog. He writes carefully on the back and takes it out to place in the Upcoming Screenings sign; the bailiffs won&#x2019;t cover that up with metal boards:<br><br>On behalf of Gunn and Vivienne MacRae, I want to say a huge thank-you to all of our faithful customers&#x2014;it was my family&#x2019;s privilege to shine a light in the dark here for over sixty years and there is nothing we would rather have done. Running such an extraordinary cinema would not have been possible without all of you. Babylon was our family business but it was also our home. May the film reels (somewhere, for all of us) play on!<br><br>With Gratitude,<br><br>Dylan MacRae<br><br>Lights flash outside the peep show next door. He puts his hand on the glass foyer door and steps back into the dim. Dylan has an image of his mother in his head&#x2014;she is sitting in the front row wearing a miner&#x2019;s hat with a lamp on the front, reading in a circle of light but keeping the darkness always close enough to touch. They keep playing. These little film reels in his brain. He wants to go upstairs and find her jumper and put it on, so he can smell her and sit down in the front row and drink all the gin left in the cellar, but he&#x2019;s sure that would be a bit Bundy or some other random psychopath who had issues with their mother. He has no issues, he just misses them both more than he can take. He picks up the deeds for the caravan, the address, his bus ticket. He grabs her suitcase and pulls the old Exit door closed behind him.<br><br>It is so cold on the city streets that his skin stings and reddens; he needs to buy warmer clothes, some kind of winter boots. His throat is so tight and constricted it is hard to swallow. He checks his watch and there is still over an hour before the bus leaves, so he heads for the river&#x2014;he wants to see it before he goes. Red lights flash on and off, lighting up the pavement as he walks away from Babylon. He wants to turn around, but for the very first time in his life there is absolutely nowhere to go back to. With each step forward the road behind him disappears. That&#x2019;s what it feels like. Just one step back and it would be an endless plummet. His shoes click on the wet pavement. His breath curls on the air. He is going to go along by the river even though it takes longer because for once in his life he has left with time to spare. Ornate lampposts with wrought-iron fish at the bottoms of them sparkle with frost. It is way too early in the year for it to be as Baltic as this, they&#x2019;ve only just hit November.</p></p><h2>Jung and the Story of Our Time</h2><p>Written by a friend of C.G.

It spans Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez&#x2019;s life from his birth in 1927 through the start of his career as a writer to the moment in the 1950s when he proposed to the woman who would become his wife. It has the shape, the quality, and the vividness of a conversation with the reader&#x2014;a tale of people, places, and events as they occur to him: the colorful stories of his eccentric family members; the great influence of his mother and maternal grandfather; his consuming career in journalism, and the friends and mentors who encouraged him; the myths and mysteries of his beloved Colombia; personal details, undisclosed until now, that would appear later, transmuted and transposed, in his fiction; and, above all, his fervent desire to become a writer. And, as in his fiction, the narrator here is an inspired observer of the physical world, able to make clear the emotions and passions that lie at the heart of a life&#x2014;in this instance, his own.<br><br><i>Living to Tell the Tale</i> is a radiant, powerful, and beguiling memoir that gives us the formation of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez as a writer and as a man.</p><p><i>Living to Tell the Tale</i>, the first of three projected volumes in the memoirs of Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garcia M�rquez, narrates what, on the surface appears to be the portrait of the young artist through the mid-1950s. But the masterful work, which draws on the craft of the author's best fiction, has a depth and richness that transcends straightforward autobiography. <p> Echoing Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited</i>, M�rquez uses his memoir as justification for telling an artful story that challenges notions of authoritative record or chronology. Time is porous in M�rquez's Colombia, flowing back and forth among the mythic moments of his personal history to accommodate his fascination for place. While recalling a trip he took as an adult to his grandparents' house in Aracataca, he veers suddenly back to childhood and his earliest infant memories in that house. Nearly one hundred pages have passed before he returns effortlessly to the pivotal moment on the trip when he declares to himself and family: "I'm going to be a writer... Nothing but a writer.'</p><p> Similarly, M�rquez toys with the boundaries of truth and fiction throughout his book. He acknowledges that his memory is often faulty, especially with regards to his crucial, formative years with his grandparents. And his explorations of key moments in his life show that, despite his vivid mental snapshots, the events were often temporally impossible. Further, he colors his tale with recollections of ghostly presences and occult events that pass without a wink into his narrative, alongside the documented accounts of his early successes as a poet and singer or details of his first published writings. </p><p> With its play on time and truth, memory and storytelling, <i>Living to Tell the Tale</i>'s literary form acts as early evidence for M�rquez's inevitable calling as a writer, and the language of Edith Grossman's translation, which frequently skirts the boundaries of poetry, mirrors M�rquez's effort. While he meanders on his picaresque artistic journey--distracted by trysts with a married woman, the tumult of Colombian politics, and the raw energy of the journalist's life--he ends this first volume with the tantalizing promise of the literary career about to explode, and the impossible prospect of even greater riches for his readers. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, author of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude, </i>received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982.

Based on the life of a real boy, it tells the story of Charley Goddard, who lies his way into the Union Army at the age of 15. Charley has never been anyplace beyond Winona, Minnesota, and thinks war would be a great adventure. And it is--at first--as his regiment marches off through cheering crowds and pretty, flag-waving girls. But then comes the battle. Charley screams, "Make it stop now!" disbelieving that anything so horrible could be real. Paulsen is unsparing in the details of what actually happens on the battlefield: the living men suddenly blown into pieces, the agony and fear, the noise and terror, the stinking corpses. After many battles, Charley is wounded and sent home an old man before he is 20, his will to live destroyed by combat fatigue--leaving him with a "soldier's heart." Paulsen has received the Margaret A. Edwards Award, the ALAN Award, and several Newbery Honor awards for previous work, but this superb, small masterpiece transcends any of his earlier titles in its remarkable, memorable intensity and power.

This tale of Meleager, prince of Calydon, and Atalanta, huntress-princess of Arcadia, centers on the boar they hunted together. In a wonderfully imagined scene, Evslin has Artemis create the boar early on, from "vital mud" of the Styx, as a personal monster to rival those of other gods. He tells how at Meleager's birth a Fate foretold that he would not die until a a certain brand burning on the hearth was consumed--and how his mother snatched it up and locked it away to ensure his life. One of Evslin's twists in using the legend of Atalanta (exposed at birth and reared by bears) is having her wrestle the chance-met Meleager and her shock of discovery that he and she are alike. Their love and popular acclaim of Atalanta's hunting prowess enrages Artemis, who whistles up her monster boar in vengeance. Atalanta joins other heroes to stop its ravages. When Meleager awards her the boar pelt, his uncles (here shown as evil plotters) protest and are slain. Meleager's mother avenges her brothers' deaths by burning the brand--and Atalanta grieves as she goes on to other adventures. The liberties Evslin takes with variations of legends, well in keeping with tradition, enhance the tellings--as does the art, ranging from painted Greek vases, Roman mosaics, and modern paintings, that illustrates the well-designed volume. --Ruth M.

But two unusually adventurous girls-a rich merchant's daughter, Nancy Kington, and her former plantation slave, Minerva Sharpe-take to the high seas from Jamaica on a ship the crew renames <i>Deliverance</i>. Not just any trading ship, the <i>Deliverance</i> flies black flags from its mast, proclaiming to all that the newly named, hijacked ship is a pirate vessel, striking fear into the hearts of those she approaches. Or so they hope. <br>For Nancy, the <i>Deliverance </i>is her escape from an arranged betrothal to a controlling and devilish man. For Minerva, it is escape from slavery, as well as from the fearsome overseer on Nancy's family plantation. But in the end, the money, the adventure, the companionship, and the chance to see the world not as women, but as bold and daring pirates, is an opportunity neither can ignore. <br>A powerful, thrilling, and ultimately inspiring journey of two women who break the bonds of gender, race, and position to find their own way to glory. <br>Recognition <br>A Book Sense Top Ten Children's Pick A PW Daily Editor's Pick An ALA Best Book for Young Adults A YALSA Top Ten Teen Book An International Reading Association Young Adult Choice VOYA's Top Shelf Fiction for Middle School Readers A New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age A Texas Tayshas Reading List Book A Michigan Library Association Teen Services Division "Thumbs Up" Award A Kentucky Bluegrass Awards Reading List Book Nominated for the 2006 Nevada Young Reader's Award in the YA category <br><i>Pirates! </i>has been awarded the 2004 Michigan Library Association Teen Services Division Thumbs Up!

Marini explores the full range of American sacred music and demonstrates how the meanings and functions of this musical expression can contribute to a greater understanding of religious culture.&nbsp;Marini examines the role of sacred song across the United States, from the musical traditions of Native Americans and the Hispanic peoples of the Southwest, to the Sacred Harp singers of the rural South and the Jewish music revival to the music of the Mormon, Catholic, and Black churches. Including chapters on New Age and Neo-Pagan music, gospel music, and hymnals as well as interviews with iconic composers of religious music, <i>Sacred Song in America</i> pursues a historical, musicological, and theoretical inquiry into the complex roles of ritual music in the public religious culture of contemporary America.</p><p>Exploring sacred song as an integral element of religious culture in America<b>Stephen A.

The scene of both fiction and verse is the author's native rural, western North Carolina; Chappell is a regionalist who speaks with the unmistakable authority of the native son. But his scene can also be the London visited by Franz Joseph Haydn, projected in a fanciful metaphoric tale (title story in the collection Moments of Light, or a university town (Chappell teaches at Duke). Seen in perspective, his work displays thematic range and venturesomeness; the collection offers a welcome opportunity to watch him shed the excessively literary and experimental manner of his early work. Present throughout are his taste for the strange and grotesque (as in the novel Dagon and a sense of hovering violence, as in the oblique "Children of Strikers," set in the mill town that is also a familiar presence in his work. In an afterword Chappell says that he is not an "important figure"; it is enough that he is a good, humane, versatile one. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Slave Girl of Gor</h2><p>Taken as a possession, Judy Thornton, an Earth resident, is found meandering in the wilderness of the Earthlike planet of Gor.

Here&#39;s an excerpt: &#34;In attentively contemplating the fleeting nature of life, nothing is more fleeting than our journey through this world. It is an all too short dream. Has anyone lived for 10,000 years? Life swiftly passes, and how many have lived for even a hundred years? &#34;Whether I am first or whether others are first; whether it is to be today or whether it is to be tomorrow, who is to know? Those who are sent off before us are countless as the drops of dew. &#34;Though in the morning we may be radiant with health, in the evening we may be of white ashes. When the winds of impermanence blow, our eyes are closed forever. And as we breath our last breath, our face loses its color. Our beloved ones gather and lament to no avail. The body is carried to an open field and disappears in smoke which smolders through the night, leaving only the white ashes. Is there any expression for such a sad plight? &#34;The fragile nature of human life underlies both the young and old. We should therefore, all the sooner, turn our hearts to the singularly important matter of True Life. We should recite the Nembutsu upon having completely entrusted all that we are to the Buddha Amida. &#34;In gratitude do we acknowledge these words...&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Forgotten Fantasy - Sunday Comics, 1900-1915: Visions from Lyonel Feininger, Winsor McCay and Many More (Giants of the American Comic Strip)</h2><p>First in a new Anthology series from Sunday Press, acclaimed publisher full-size comic strip volumes. of Presented here in the original size and colors are the complete comics of Lyonel Feininger:The Kin-der-Kids and Wee Willie Winkie&#39;s World; along with the complete adventures of:The Explorigator by Henry Grant Dart, Nibsy the Newsboy by George McManus, and Naughty Pete by Charles Forbell Plus, color Dream of the Rarebit Fiend and Jungle Imp pages by Winsor McCay. With dozens more fantastical Sundays from John Gruelle, Gustave Verbeek, Herbert Crowley, John R. Neill and others. The dawn of the 20th century saw technological advances that were only dreamed of decades before. One such advance was four-color printing, which brought to life stories inspired by both the new technologies of the era and the children&#39;s fiction enjoyed by a growing middle class. This confluence brought about a unique genre within a new art form-the Fantasy Comic Strip. These pages were a Sunday staple for less than two decades, soon replaced by humorous family comics that more closely mirrored the modern society. But from 1900 to 1915, American newspapers offered some of the most fascinating comics ever printed. And while Winsor McCay&#39;s Little Nemo in Slumberland is known worldwide, many of the great fantasy comics have virtually vanished-until now.

The ministers, Europe' racing waiters, run from one lost position to another and fresh misfortune flourishes in the ruins!</i></p><p>Having fled to Paris in 1933 following Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Joseph Roth wrote a series of articles in that "hour before the end of the world" which he foresaw was to come and&nbsp;that would culminate in World War II. This collection has never before been translated into English. Incisive and ironic, the writing evokes Roth's bitterness and despair at the coming annihilation of the free world while displaying his great nostalgia for the Hapsburg Empire into which he was born and his ingrained fear of nationalism in any form. Detailing the duplicities and criminalities of the Nazi regime, Roth denounced the terror sewn by Nazi storm troopers, the propaganda of Goebbels, the round ups, the assassinations, and the construction of concentration camps, alongside the seeming blindness of the rest of Europe, which appeared paralyzed in the face of Nazi expansion. Following the Anchluss in 1938, Roth, isolated in Paris, sunk into morbid alcoholism which lead to his death the following year. Within 12&nbsp;months the Germans had overrun Paris.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Roth</b> (1894&#x2013;1939) was an Austrian novelist best known for his family saga <i>Radetzky March</i> and for his novel of Jewish life, <i>Job</i>.

Printed in December 2003</p><p>A generously unrestricted theme events that take place in a single terrifying night and talented contributors build high expectations for this quartet of brand new horror novellas, most of which, alas, disappoint in their failure to develop a plot suitable for their length. Bentley Little's "The Circle," the only tale that faithfully limits its events to a single evening, presents three interrelated vignettes of weird incidents in a suburban neighborhood, all of which prove to have an explanation that is surprisingly humdrum by genre standards. Christopher Golden's "Pyre," in which a young woman comes to terms with her estranged father by means of supernatural experience, depends on a labored back story about a Maine island haunted by Viking ghosts. In "Jonah Rose," Tom Piccirilli spends more time elaborating his narrator's convoluted history as a former faith healer who took up with sideshow freaks than establishing that history's bearing on his mission to rescue his kidnapped son from a strange urban underworld. Only Douglas Clegg's "The Words," about two teenage outsiders whose alienation leads them into the creepy "world of Nowhere," uses its expansive length to build the atmosphere and tension crucial for orchestrating its unsettling events. Each of these stories has its moments, which suggests their authors might have produced better offerings outside the anthology's write-to-format limitations.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hunchback of Notre Dame (English and French Edition)</h2><p>An alchemist&#39;s effort to abduct a beautiful gypsy girl leads to her execution and a futile rescue by the hunchback Quasimodo</p><p>Designed for school districts, educators, and students seeking to maximize performance on standardized tests, Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Victor Hugo's flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the <br>day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Mis�rables, which Hugo would write thirty years later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral. The inscription had been eradicated by the time the book was published, and Hugo feared that Notre-Dame's Gothic splendor might soon be lost to the contemporary fad for tearing down old buildings. Notre-Dame has survived as one of the great monuments of Paris, and Hugo's novel is a fitting celebration of it, a popular classic that is proving to be just as enduring.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Dalton Fury passed away in 2016.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Eastern Afghanistan, early February 2013</i> <br>A menagerie of animal-named armored vehicles trundled along a rutted dirt road deep in Taliban territory near the Pakistan border. The temperature hovered around freezing, not bad for early February, and dusk was only two hours away. <br>The mission was simple enough&#x2014;clear ten klicks of heavily mined road leading to a Taliban-controlled village that was acting as a hub for three rat lines funneling Taliban and Haqqani fighters infiltrating into Afghanistan. It was an important mission, and its success would severely hamper the Taliban&#x2019;s spring offensive, but there was zero chance it would make the six o&#x2019;clock news back home. This was no Thunder Run, the rumbling charge of M1 Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles that blew through Baghdad like metal hail through lace during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. It couldn&#x2019;t even compare with the Syrian armored runs of T-72s and BMP armored fighting vehicles through the Damascus suburb of Daraya. No, this was an excruciating crawl, where progress was measured in feet, sometimes inches. <br>It was day 5, and the column was still a klick out. Leading the way on this godforsaken goat path were a pair of ten-ton, two-man Husky 2G armored vehicles equipped with four large electronics-bay panels affixed to their fronts. Each vehicle swept one side of the road using the Niitek Visor 2500 ground-penetrating radar set housed within the panels. They were looking for IEDs. They&#x2019;d already found three today, for a total of twelve since the mission began. Seven of the IEDs had had enough explosive power to easily kill the heaviest vehicle in the column. Finding them before they could be detonated had been a major success, but as the saying went, you only needed to miss one IED to have a very bad day. <br>It was an arms race, pitting sophisticated electronics and up-armored vehicles against guile and ever-increasing explosive power. It seemed criminal now to think troops had once traversed these roads in nothing more than standard Toyota pickup, but then you went to war with what you had, and back in 2001, IEDs weren&#x2019;t an issue. <br>As the armored vehicles slowly rolled forward, a herd of seven Buffalo armored vehicles followed. Tipping the scales at over twenty-three tons apiece, the six-wheeled Buffalos looked and sounded like growling metal monsters. Their sheer size and power were so ferocious that one even made an appearance in a blockbuster movie as a shape-shifting warrior-robot. <br>Fearsome or not, a bundle of four 155mm artillery shells left over from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and buried two feet below the ground could turn fierce, blowing up and scattering bits of metal&nbsp;&#x2026; and flesh. And so the column inched forward, the Huskies scanning the dirt for hidden death while, following from a safe distance, were the Buffalos, each carrying a complement of four dismounts&#x2014;a cold term for the soldiers that would, if necessary, leave the protection of the Buffalo&#x2019;s heavily armored V-shaped hull and patrol on foot. <br>Forty klicks away at Jalalabad Airfield, Kolt &#x201c;Racer&#x201d; Raynor sat perched uncomfortably on a cardboard box full of MREs in his Bravo Assault Team&#x2019;s lounge area and watched the progress of the armored column on a fifty-inch flat screen. The feed came live from a UAV loitering some fifteen thousand feet above the column. A small box on the upper left of the screen showed an infrared view of the same area. So far, the only hot spots were the column&#x2019;s vehicles and a trio of donkeys huddled on the leeward side of a rocky hill a hundred yards in front of the Huskies. It wasn&#x2019;t as sexy as a Tier One high-value individual, but the hot spots would get Kolt and his men out the door. Tonight, they were on tap working a TST&#x2014;time-sensitive target. Specifically, they were focused on the triggermen. While some IEDs were rigged to detonate on contact via a simple pressure plate, others were remote-detonated, the explosion set off by the thumb of a triggerman. For that to work, the terrorists would need to be within a couple hundred meters, hidden from the naked eye somewhere in the rocky outcrop. Kolt could have contacted the gunners in the Buffalos to tell them to forget the damn donkeys and sweep for two-legged asses, but the young army officer on target didn&#x2019;t need white noise from someone back in the rear, even if it was Kolt Raynor. Besides, Kolt stiff-armed micromanaging as a practice himself. <br>&#x201c;We should be out there, not here,&#x201d; Kolt said under his breath. Forty klicks, even by helo, was far too long for a so-called rapid response. Kolt looked around the room. He was an invited guest here, and so he kept his thoughts to himself. Yes, he was their commander, but sometimes the smartest thing you did in command was to do nothing at all. Besides, he wasn&#x2019;t going to gripe to the men about how it should be. It was important to keep that subtle separation between the commander and the commanded. After a decade plus of war, everyone in the room was war weary, and the hunger to mix it up with the bad guys had abated years ago, something certainly not lost on Kolt. <br>Kolt accepted his fate, for the moment, and turned away from &#x201c;Thunder Turtle&#x2019;s&#x201d; agonizing progress to look around the tent. All four of Kolt&#x2019;s assault teams lived in tents that had once been green. They were now covered by a half inch of brown dust, which clung to everything, even the interior. Between the dust and the clutter, it could have been a cave. <br>The operators chilled out on green nylon, squeaky, foldout army cots, whose aluminum legs never seemed to balance correctly on the plywood floors. Individual shelves were fashioned out of half-inch plywood and two-by-fours with small head-high walls placed between each bunk to give an impression of privacy. There wasn&#x2019;t any really, unless they considered their five-by-six-foot space an island. <br>Kolt stood up and walked over to the door and cracked it open. He reached into the cargo pocket of his Crye Precision G3 combat pants and yanked out a half-empty pouch of Red Man. <i>It&#x2019;s going to be dark soon,</i> he thought as he pulled three fingers of leaf and slipped it between his cheek and gum. Another day come and gone with little to show for it. Too many days had gone like this for the thirty bearded Delta operators. Sequestered in relative secrecy inside a small area of Jalalabad Airfield, it was easy to imagine being stranded on a very desolate island. Worse, rescue did not loom on the horizon. With the United States and Afghanistan signing a security agreement years earlier, control of military operations was moving over to Afghan forces. American troops and equipment were departing the war zone at a rapid rate. But not for the EOD troops out on Thunder Turtle, and definitely not for spec-ops troops like Delta. Like it or not, they were here to stay. And as long as al Qaeda still threatened either the fragile Afghan government or, more importantly, the security of the United States, operators would be sticking around. <br>A noise made Kolt turn. Bravo guys were hooting and pointing at something on the screen. Kolt squinted to get it into focus, then shook his head. Based on the blurred heat signature, it appeared as if one of the donkeys was getting it on with another one. <br>Kolt checked his watch and figured they had about another hour or so to go. One more hour of this mind-numbing sitting and waiting for something to happen before dusk fell and Thunder Turtle turned and headed back to their FOB. This was his life at J-bad. Hours followed by days of boredom, punctuated by sporadic short-notice, quick-strike missions in the more dangerous and unforgiving parts of Afghanistan. It had been that way since their first deployment after 9/11. Even with a decade of Groundhog Days behind them, and Osama bin Laden taken out two years earlier, not much had changed. <br>In Afghanistan during the twenty-first century, just as during centuries before when Alexander&#x2019;s legions were there, adrenaline rushes could be served up in a moment. One minute the troops could be watching a column of armored vehicles crawl across a lunar-like landscape, and the next they could be engaged in a bitter firefight with insanely reckless insurgents. If it came to that, Kolt knew he had a hell of an advantage. <br>There was a lot of experience inside the tent that night. Four of the five members of Bravo Team had spent close to twelve years rotating back and forth from the States to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The newest operator on the team had just done over four years of combat time. Moreover, in between the months of hunting the ghost-like Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, they all had seen years of harsh urban combat in Iraq and had eaten plenty of brownout in east Africa. Along with the valor awards, most had TBI (traumatic brain injury) from eating too many IEDs or wall-breaching charges to prove it. And most, if not all, figured they were sure-bet candidates as future sufferers of PTSD. <br>Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was an operator&#x2019;s paradise. There was always something to blow up, someone to rescue, someone to kill. Intel nuggets uncovered from one raid dominoed to the next raid and then the next raid and so on. More times than not, almost before they returned to their sleeping quarters, savvy intel analysts had added some previously unknown individual to the link-analysis poster of foreign fighters and Shia militia leaders. For most the war, pace in Iraq was missed, but for some the lines between right and wrong were blurring, and killing had become either too sport like or numbing. <br>Now, on this cold late-winter night in northeastern Afghanistan, all but one of the team members sat on their asses. The only one earning his hazardous-duty pay, Shaft, was three hours and forty-five minutes away. <br>Unlike the rest of them, Shaft was working the sexy Tier One target&#x2014;the one with National Command Authority attention. <br>&#x201c;Shaft make his last comms window?&#x201d; Slapshot, the burly troop sergeant major asked Kolt. <br>&#x201c;Last check he was still looking for jackasses,&#x201d; answered Kolt, barely turning from the screen. He tilted his head, placed his upper lip delicately over the open end of the empty water bottle, and deposited a stream of Red Man leaf-tobacco juice. <br>Without looking up from the latest copy of <i>Maxim</i> magazine, Digger jumped in. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t have trouble with that in the Hindu Kush.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dude, the four-legged kind. It&#x2019;s a long walk down the valley,&#x201d; Slapshot answered as he shook his head in mock disgust. &#x201c;Although if that pair become a m�nage � trois, who knows?&#x201d; he said, pointing at the flat screen. <br>&#x201c;A m�nage � what?&#x201d; Digger asked. <br>&#x201c;A frickin&#x2019; three way, dumbass!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, the number of appendages is about the only difference,&#x201d; Digger quipped back as he dropped the magazine to his chest to steal a look at his troop daddy. <br>Kolt chuckled, careful not to appear to take sides between two assaulters exchanging jabs. <br>&#x201c;Think Ghafour is there?&#x201d; Slapshot asked Kolt with an obvious change in tone. He was referring to the sixty-four-year-old Pashtun elder Haji Mohammad Ghafour, a terrorist they were keen to get their hands on. <br>&#x201c;Who the hell knows, Slapshot? I guess I better believe it, or I should never have sent Shaft,&#x201d; Kolt answered. <br>&#x201c;My money says he ain&#x2019;t, but don&#x2019;t start second-guessing your instincts now, boss.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t think sending Shaft was smart, why didn&#x2019;t you pipe up?&#x201d; Kolt asked. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve known you too long, Racer. It wouldn&#x2019;t have mattered what I thought,&#x201d; answered Slapshot. <br>Kolt didn&#x2019;t answer, turning his attention back to the plasma screen and Thunder Turtle. He knew he pushed it more than most. It had gotten him in trouble more times than most, and many an operator could credit their Silver Star or Purple Heart to one of Kolt&#x2019;s impetuous command decisions. He knew some of his calls hadn&#x2019;t played out as planned. Several of his mates whose names were engraved on the unit-memorial wall in the garden were daily reminders to everyone who walked the Spine of Delta compound. Even so, his men knew he was an action magnet, drawing fire exponentially more times than most troop commanders, and if you were still in Delta after ten-plus years of war, you pretty much recognized two absolutes: you were either divorced or about to be, and running with Kolt would guarantee trigger time or a body bag. It was still a volunteer organization, and selection was an ongoing process. <br>With the war in Afghanistan still going after twelve years and counting, and with the most wanted man in the world, the al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden so much fish food, the targets for Tier One outfits like Delta had changed. The new number 1 on Delta&#x2019;s target list was the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri, Z-man as he was known in SOF circles. He&#x2019;d taken the reigns of al Qaeda soon after bin Laden was killed and was still at large. Ghafour, a relatively unknown entity until recently, had rocketed up the list because of his long-term relationship with Z-man. <br>Despite the intelligence, no one knew where either man was. Rounding up former acquaintances of targets had long been an operational method for American special operations forces. Some referred to the targets as the &#x201c;low-hanging fruit.&#x201d; The hope, and it often was more hope than anything else, was that they would reveal something about the targets above them. Over the years, the technique had mixed results. <br>Finding Ghafour could very well mean finding Zawahiri, but recent intelligence had revealed that finding Ghafour was becoming crucial for an entirely different reason. The CIA no longer considered Ghafour simply low-hanging fruit. <br>After nearly a year of combing through the treasure trove of computer files, hard drives, thumb drives, and handwritten documents in Arabic that SEAL Team Six had taken out of bin Laden&#x2019;s hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, information about Ghafour had surfaced. Hidden within Osama&#x2019;s extensive pornography collection, an analyst with insomnia discovered encrypted general plans linking Ghafour to the planning of attacks on commercial nuclear power plants. Two of the plants were located in Europe, but three others were only referred to by a crude code using the letters X, Y, and Z. The analyst and Kolt agreed one hundred percent, figuring X, Y, and Z were almost certainly in the U.S. of A. <br>It was enough to get the president&#x2019;s attention, as well as the attention of every leader of America&#x2019;s allies. And since the recent international uproar, when the rogue Syrian regime used sarin gas on its own citizens, showed that there was only a limited appetite from the &#x201c;coalition of the willing&#x201d; for responding to international incidents, POTUS couldn&#x2019;t afford to be soft on a potential attack on American soil. Unlike much of what was discovered in Abbottabad that night, which was declassified and shared with the world, every important acronymed organization or agency that listed national security as one of its core responsibilities agreed that the MTSAK files, curiously pronounced &#x201c;empty sack,&#x201d; should remain top secret. Truth be told, just as he didn&#x2019;t with the civil war in Syria, Kolt didn&#x2019;t give two shits about Haji Ghafour, until the connection to the homeland was uncovered. Otherwise, he would never have asked Shaft to hang it out on a singleton mission in the Pakistani badlands. <br>&#x201c;Maybe we should roll up and squeeze those donkeys,&#x201d; Kolt said, watching as the animals finished their afternoon delight and set off on a path that would intersect with the column of armored vehicles. &#x201c;Did they get a good look at those animals?&#x201d; Kolt asked Slapshot, knowing he had an earbud in while monitoring the Thunder Turtle radio transmissions.</p><h2>America Against Itself: Moral Vision and the Public Order</h2><p>An even-tempered (if rather partisan) critique of the American soul as it exhibits itself on the different fronts of our ``culture war.&#39;&#39; Neuhaus (Unsecular America, 1986, etc.) traces the traumas of our social and political life back to their ontological roots and supplies a prognosis that will undoubtedly scandalize as many as it sways. A Catholic priest and scholar who presides over the Institute of Religion and Public Life, Neuhaus has concentrated his sociological efforts for some years now on the intersection between the political and the spiritual in American life. In doing so, he has run counter to prevailing notions of secularism--held only, he maintains, by an elite minority--that would, he says, collapse all religious impulses into an entirely private realm. Neuhaus skips over the more obvious examples of conflict--school prayer, Nativity scenes in public parks, etc.--and attempts in more theoretical terms to show that liberal democracy (in its American incarnation) requires a religious foundation if it is to succeed as a unifying social force. He draws on his experiences with the civil-rights movement to show how a religious vocabulary can be used--as it was by Martin Luther King--to bring together even the most mutually antagonistic groups. One might question Neuhaus&#39;s optimism in light of the increasing lack of cohesion in most mainline churches today, and parts of his argument display an inclination toward the sort of ``throne-and-altar&#39;&#39; alliance that has bedeviled European reactionaries for two hundred years--but his analysis of the seeming void around which the ``secular&#39;&#39; consensus is built, and the fragility of the social structures that depend upon that consensus, is challenging, prescient, and ominous. And his chapters on the abortion issue, while hardly impartial, are remarkably free of the usual cant. A trifle glib and overconfident, Neuhaus&#39;s tone can irritate. His thesis, however, is original enough to compel attention and forceful enough to provoke thought. -- Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</p><p>Partly autobiographical, slightly polemical, and thoroughly challenging, America Against Itself is an in-depth, multifaceted analysis of the pervasive cultural warfare that threatens to undermine the American social structure. Richard John Neuhaus, author of The Naked Public Square, employs a large measure of social criticism, moral philosophy, and religious reflection in analyzing this contemporary Kulturkampf. He addresses the limits and imperatives of politics as well as religion&#39;s role in defining our common culture. Among the subjects tackled are the abortion debate, the urban underclass, and the nature of altruism in a world that rewards uncaring. In addition, Neuhaus reflects on his role in &#34;The Movement&#34; of the 1960s, and how, despite its idealistic intentions, it went so wildly wrong. America Against Itself is not a prolonged lamentation against the prevailing moral and intellectual decline that seems characteristic of the contemporary era. Instead, Neuhaus presents a careful and sympathetic analysis of why we have turned against the highest ideals of the American experiment, and issues a bracing call to turn anew to the challenging vision of &#34;a new order for the ages&#34;. This book is a disturbing, but ultimately hopeful, testament from one of America&#39;s foremost public intellectuals, whose passage through three tumultuous decades proves a valuable qualification for probing the complex issue of conflicting moralities struggling to exist in a representative democracy.Richard John Neuhaus, one of the foremost authorities on religion in the contemporary world and president of the Institute on Religion and Public Life, is the editor-in-chief of First Things.

Since Eden, Western mas has never found the explanation for his fate in guilt and sin. The reality principle has defeated the pleasure principle, and there is no escape from time. The Indian, on the other hand, seeks a still point outside of time; he has never lost Eden.

In the cold winter moonlight, Steven Vermilya and three companions piled out of the car after the ninety-minute drive from Las Vegas, unloading their tackle boxes and poles for a long night of fishing for striped bass and catfish. They would have this part of the lake to themselves. The nearest settlement was Nelson&#x2019;s Landing, some five miles to the west, deep in Eldorado Canyon, where the bullet-riddled &#x201c;No Trespassing&#x201d; signs nearly outnumbered the hardy inhabitants.<br>Carrying their gear, the fishermen stumbled down the rocky slope until they reached a cliff that dropped off into nothing but darkness. They backtracked and found a loose gravel path that led them to an old boat launch area that had been washed out by floodwaters in the 1970s. They had nothing but a single flashlight and the moonlight to guide them&#x2014;Steven acknowledged that the trip wasn&#x2019;t well thought out&#x2014;and by the time they reached water&#x2019;s edge even the moonlight began to fade behind gathering clouds.<br>They fished for about four hours at the landing, where a century earlier steamers had unloaded men and supplies for the gold and silver mines up the canyon. Eldorado was a boomtown in those days, larger, richer and meaner than the dusty stopover on the desert floor that the Spanish explorers had named Las Vegas&#x2014;The Meadows&#x2014;for its oases. The notorious Indian outlaw Queho had lived and died in this wild canyon. His mummified body would be found in a cliff-side cave, the leathery remains lying next to the watchman&#x2019;s badge belonging to one of the 20 people he was said to have murdered.<br>But this night, January 21, 1995, all was quiet and cool. A gentle rain began to fall. The fish weren&#x2019;t biting. It was so dark the men couldn&#x2019;t see the jagged mountains on the Arizona side of the lake. By 1 a.m.&#x2014;now Saturday&#x2014;they were tired and cold. They packed up their gear and headed for home. The trek back proved to be tougher than the hike down. The four men walked in a tight, single-file line, with Vermilya at the front, and a buddy behind him holding the flashlight. They stumbled and slipped on the steep, loose ground, basically stones and gravel on top of solid rock. They couldn&#x2019;t find the trail they took down, so they headed up a ravine.<br>They were about halfway up the ravine when they spotted it. Steven didn&#x2019;t even see it at first, focused as he was on the terrain in front of him. But the flashlight beam from behind him had caught it, just off to the right.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a human skull!&#x201d; one of the men behind Steven shouted.<br>He thought they were teasing him. By now, the men were so uncomfortable that grim humor had set in. But this was no joke. There lay a skull on the rocky ground, resting on what would have been its left cheek. Clearly visible were the fillings in the teeth and what looked like cartilage holding the jaw to the rest of the skull.<br>Steven and two of the other men were trained military policemen, from Nellis Air Force Base north of Las Vegas. They knew enough not to touch it.<br>The plan was to get home to Las Vegas and call the police. They scampered up the ravine to their car, threw their gear inside and drove out of the overlook parking area, up the narrow road that wound through Eldorado Canyon.<br>They never seriously considered stopping in Nelson&#x2019;s Landing to use a phone. There were no gas stations or stores, only the little houses and mobile homes, which didn&#x2019;t look inviting. On the way to the lake, they had seen a sign on a building that read: &#x201c;Do Not Stop Here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;After we found the skull,&#x201d; Steven recalled, &#x201c;the sign kind of took on a new meaning.&#x201d;<br>By daybreak, they&#x2019;d return to Eldorado Canyon, where riches and death have long been intertwined like the gold running through the quartz in a glory hole that turned out to be a deadly bridal chamber.<br>Detective Phil Ramos got the phone call at home about noon on Saturday, January 21, 1995. It was his supervisor, Sgt. Bill Keeton. &#x201c;Guess what?&#x201d; Keeton prodded him.<br>Ramos didn&#x2019;t have to guess. He and Vaccaro weren&#x2019;t the on-call detectives that weekend&#x2014;that was Mike Franks and partner Brent Becker&#x2014;so Keeton could only be calling about one thing. There was a break in the biggest case of their careers.<br>Ramos and Vaccaro arranged to drive separately to Nelson&#x2019;s Landing, where they would meet Franks and Becker, who had been there for hours. It was a glorious afternoon, the kind of crisp, clean day that could only follow a rain, El Ni�o taking a breather. As they traveled across the desert, the road through Eldorado Canyon became narrow and winding after the little settlement of Nelson&#x2019;s Landing, the center stripe disappearing altogether as the neglected pavement turned bumpy. All along the road, past the abandoned mines where the locals insisted there was still plenty of gold and silver left for anybody with the grit to go after it, one sign after another issued warnings and prohibitions: &#x201c;No Shooting Area. Loaded Weapons Prohibited.&#x201d; Others warned, &#x201c;Watch Downhill Speed,&#x201d; &#x201c;No Dumping,&#x201d; &#x201c;No Trespassing,&#x201d; &#x201c;Road Narrows.&#x201d; Many of them were aerated by shotgun blasts; the no-shooting admonition obviously carried little weight in this remote canyon.<br>Ramos and Vaccaro arrived at the parking area overlooking Lake Mohave. Much of the crime scene had been processed by the time Ramos and Vaccaro got there. The detectives were given the basics: Four fishermen had stumbled onto a skull in a rocky ravine the night before. Three of them had returned to Nelson&#x2019;s Landing to point out the skull&#x2014;the fourth had had to work that morning. They were interviewed and let go.<br>The scene was being processed by analyst Sheree Norman, who had been called to Nelson&#x2019;s Landing at 11 that morning. She made a diagram of the area and had photos taken. The skull was located about 70 yards away from the roadway, down the steep embankment, in a gully carved out by rainwater running down toward the lake, another couple hundred yards away. The skull was remarkably well preserved; the jaw was still attached, the ligaments having survived the elements. The skull had a small blackened area, as if the head had been exposed to fire. In the back of the skull were three small holes&#x2014;very possibly bullet holes.<br>As the police were being led to the skull by the fishermen earlier that morning, they found what could have been the source of the charring. A fire pit was located just a few yards up the hill from the skull. There were small bone fragments in the pit. Norman recalled that the area was &#x201c;not unlike what you found in a barbecue pit.&#x201d; Only this appeared to be a human barbecue. On a bluff above, Norman saw more bone fragments next to bird droppings. &#x201c;We speculate there was a lot of animal activity helping themselves to what was left in the fire pit,&#x201d; she said.<br>If this was the remains of a human, the fire had consumed any traces of clothing or shoes. There was not so much as a zipper or metal button. But amid the bones were some other things: metal bands, two hasps, a lock assembly&#x2014;in the locked position&#x2014;pieces of fire-blackened wood and remnants of a floral-design lining paper that had escaped the flames. Norman knew immediately where these had come from. They were what was left of an antique humpback chest, like the one Norman&#x2019;s mother, an antique collector, had given her when she was growing up in New Jersey. From the metal straps, she could tell that the trunk was about standard size, 20 inches by 36 inches at the base. She had no way of telling how high it was, because the straps only went around the base of the trunk. The wood that would have made up the sides was nothing but little burned scraps.<br>Some effort was likely exerted to get the trunk to this spot, suggesting that the body had been in it. A rough gravel trail led down the hill, but passed well away from the burned area. From the trail, etched in the gravel, were what Norman suspected to be parallel drag marks, about 20 inches apart, leading toward the fire pit, but stopping far short of it.<br>After the coroner&#x2019;s technician had removed the human remains, Norman had scooped up some of the burned dirt and rocks, the wood and the paper, and placed them in clean metal paint cans for testing in the police lab. She plucked out the hasps and the lock and put them in bags. She put the big metal strips in a large box. She also found a number of old-fashioned, square-shafted nails, which she collected.<br>From the fire pit, she measured the distance down the steep ravine to where the skull lay on its left side against three rocks, the eye sockets peering downhill.

It came gently, flowing through the gaps in the Blue Ridge Mountains and spilling over the valleys below, rustling the leaves outside the big house. They rustled, were still, then again they stirred.<br><br>Mat Brionne, who was not quite seven, lay awake, listening.<br><br>His father was in Washington to see President Grant, but was expected home soon, and Mat was eager for any sound that might herald his coming.<br><br>Mat loved his father, a tall, fine-looking man in uniform or out, a superb horseman, and as the neighbors said, "as fine a shot as ever held a gun."<br><br>The rustling of leaves stilled momentarily, and in the silence Mat heard a faint stir of horses moving up the lane from the highroad. These horses moved almost silently, which was not like his father's coming would be.<br><br>The curtains at the window were open, and in the faint light Mat could see the hands of the clock. He had just learned to tell time, and was very aware of each hour. It was past midnight. As he listened, the sounds ceased. Uneasy, remembering the stories of Indians and of renegades, he slipped from his bed and peered down into the yard.<br><br>For a moment he saw nothing, and then he caught the shine of an empty saddle, then a surreptitious movement in the shadows near a tree.<br><br>Frightened, he went down the hall to his mother's room. He opened the door, went in quickly, and touched her arm.<br><br>"Mother . . . there's some men outside. I heard them."<br><br>"It's your imagination, Mat. Your father won't be back until tomorrow."<br><br>"I didn't think it was pa. They're acting very quiet. I'm scared."<br><br>Anne Brionne got up and took her robe from a chair. There had been no trouble to speak of in Virginia since the end of the war, when James had been rounding up renegades.<br><br>"It's alright, Mat. No one would come to bother us. They know your father too well. Anyway, Sam would have heard them. He's sleeping in the gatehouse."<br><br>"Mother, this is Friday. Sam's never there on Friday. He goes to the tavern."<br><br>Nobody was supposed to know that, but Mat had overheard the overseer telling Sam to be careful&#x2013;that if the Major heard about it he would be discharged.<br><br>Anne Brionne stood very still, thinking. The nearest house was four miles away. Burt Webster, their overseer, had gone to visit his sister in Culpeper. The field hands were cutting firewood back in the mountains, and if Sam was gone they were alone on the place, except for the Negro maid, Malvernia.<br><br>"There's nothing to be afraid of, Mat. We'll go downstairs."<br><br>Their feet made no sound upon the soft carpets. James kept his guns locked in a cabinet in his study, but when they reached the foot of the stairs Anne Brionne paused, facing the front door. Someone was trying the door, turning the knob ever so gently. Mat heard it, too, and his grip on his mother's hand tightened.<br><br>For a moment she stood perfectly still, and in that instant she felt fear for the first time. Suddenly she knew who the men must be&#x2013;in Virginia, at this time, it could be nobody else. This was a time of peace. There had been little lawlessness since James ended the raids by the guerilla bands left over from the war.<br><br>Two years had gone by, but she still remembered the courtroom and the evil, hate-twisted face of Dave Allard as he hurled threats at her husband, Major James Brionne.<br><br>The Allards&#x2014;it was a name they adopted after leaving Missouri&#x2014;were a renegade family of doubtful origin who had been petty thieves before the war, and who blossomed into full-time thieves and murderers under cover of the war.<br><br>Dave Allard, several times a murderer, had been tracked down and captured by Major Brionne. At his trial it had been Brionne's testimony that convicted him, and he was sentenced to be hanged.<br><br>Allard had lunged from his chair screaming, "They'll kill you, Brionne! My folks'll git you! They'll see you an' yourn burn! Burn, I tell you!"<br><br>Anne Brionne forced herself now to think calmly. There was no one else it could be, and she had always feared they might come someday, although James had derided Dave Allard's words as the wild threat of a man never sound mentally.<br><br>If these were the Allards, they would be looking for James. Without a doubt they expected to find him here, and they had probably watched Sam leave for the tavern, to be sure no one else was in the house.<br><br>Now they would try the other doors and the windows. When they tried the dining-room window they would find it open, for the night had been warm and she had left the window open, as she often did, for the breeze off the mountain. She had neglected to close it, and Malvernia would not have been in that part of the house after dinner.<br><br>"Mat," she said calmly, "I want you to go down into the cellar and leave by the old root-cellar door. Go to your cave and stay there until one of us comes for you. No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, stay there until either your father or I come to get you."<br><br>"Mother, I&#x2014;"<br><br>"Do what you are told, Mat. That is the way your father would want it."<br><br>Still he hesitated. "Go," she repeated. "Go now."<br><br>A moment longer he hesitated&#x2014;he did not like to see his mother standing there, so quiet and pale. Then he fled.<br><br>Anne Brionne's glance from the study window showed several horses under the trees . . . she counted seven, and there might be others.<br><br>She unlocked the cabinet and took out the shotgun James used for hunting wild boar. It was loaded with heavy buckshot. Then she took out the pistol, a small derringer made in Philadelphia, that James had given her shortly after their marriage. It had two barrels, one under the other.<br><br>The doors from the dining room and the study faced the wide entrance hall on either side. She went up the six steps to the landing. From there the steps mounted in two wide, sweeping staircases to the second floor. On the landing there was a straight-backed chair.<br><br>Seating herself carefully, she arranged the folds of her robe about her, concealing the small gun in her lap under an edge of the gown. The shotgun she held across her knees. And there, her heart beating heavily, she waited.<br><br>This was her home. Here she had come as a bride, and Anne Brionne came of stubborn stock. Here she had lived in happiness. Here she had given birth to her son.<br><br>Generations of pioneer ancestors did not allow her to take the ownership of a home lightly. One had a home; one defended it. This was something she understood perfectly well.<br><br>She had never expected to be called upon to defend her home, although her grandmother had once defended a log cabin in this same state against an Indian attack. No, she had never expected it, but now that the moment had come she was prepared.<br><br>It was not an easy place to defend. She must frighten these intruders away, if possible. If poise and dignity could not do it, the shotgun must. In any case, Mat would be safe. The passage from the old root cellar, built for a pioneer house long ago, would allow Mat to escape to his river-bank cave. Even if they should find the passage, used only by Mat playing war games, they would not find the cave under the roots of the old oak.<br><br>After a moment, she rose. Taking a candle, she lighted it, and walked from place to place, lighting each candelabrum until the hall was as bright as for a party. Then she went back to the chair and seated herself as before.<br><br>There was no hope of keeping them out if they were determined to enter, but she hoped the shotgun might be sufficient to stop them and force them to leave. Yet deep within her she knew the man she had seen in the courtroom, shouting his threats, would not have been frightened off. Nor would his brothers or his cousins.<br><br>Fortunately, Malvernia was living in her own house behind the garden, and was not likely to be in danger. Her husband was off with the woodcutters, and she, too, was alone.<br><br>The footstep was faint, the door from the dining room opened ever so gently, and a man stood there. He was a big man with almost white hair, but he was young and strong. The muscles swelled the chest and sleeves of his shirt, a shirt that was soiled and worn, as was the vest he wore over it.<br><br>Slowly, he looked around, obviously amazed at everything he saw. A second man appeared, this one from the study door. He was slighter, and, if possible, he was dirtier than the first one. It was he who saw her.<br><br>He leaned forward, staring, as if unable to believe what his eyes told him. "It's a woman!" He spoke with astonishment. "Jest a-settin' there!"<br><br>Cotton Allard stepped further into the room. The newel post at the foot of the stairs bulked between them.<br><br>"You have come here to see Major Brionne," Anne Brionne said calmly. "He is not at home. This is not an hour at which we welcome guests. If you will come again, I am sure he will be most pleased to meet you."<br><br>"Now there's manners for ya." Cotton Allard was frankly admiring. "There sets a real lady. I allus wondered what them kind was like. Looks like we figure to find out."<br><br>"I would suggest"&#x2014;Anne Brionne's voice chilled "&#x2014;that you leave now."<br><br>Cotton Allard deliberately rolled his quid in his jaws and spat tobacco juice on the Persian rug. "I reckon with the Major gone we'll just have to make do with what's here." He turned toward the other man. "You tell the boys to take whatever they want from the house afore we set it afire. I aim to be busy right here."<br><br>"You tell 'em," the slighter man said. "I ain't a-goin' no place."<br><br>Cotton was cautious, keeping the newel post between himself and the woman. He had not yet seen the shotgun, which was partly hidden now beside her knee. Cotton could see only something dark by her hand, and something unnatural in her position.<br><br>The second man was less cautious. He stepped around in plain sight. Upstairs a door creaked faintly. So they had come up the back stairs too.<br><br>At that moment the slender, stoop-shouldered man rushed. Anne Brionne lifted the shotgun and shot him through the body.<br><br>In the hallway the boom of the gun was enormous. Anne saw the man caught in mid-stride, saw the expression of horror mask his face, and he slammed back as the charge hit him, and sprawled on his back on the floor.<br><br>Cotton Allard vaulted the banister, landing light as a cat on the landing beside her. From above, another man dropped off the balcony and the shotgun was torn from her. Coolly, she dropped her hand to the derringer, turned it on Cotton, and fired. It missed, and in almost the same instant Anne Brionne shot herself through the heart.<br><br>This it was that young Mat saw from the balcony where he had crouched, unable to leave his mother alone, but not knowing what to do. When Anne Brionne fell he gave a choking cry, and would have rushed to her.<br><br>Cotton saw him. "It's the kid!" he shouted. "Get him!"<br><br>Mat fled. Down the back stairs he went, down the steeper steps into the utter blackness of the cellar, but he needed no guide light to find the door to the old passage to the root cellar. He fled through the darkness, emerged under the trees, and glanced back toward the house just in time to see a man touch a candle to the curtains, those beautiful lace curtains his mother had imported from Alenton. The flames leaped high.<br><br>He crept down the bank, shivering and frightened. Behind the roots was his cave. He crept in and lay still, stiff and numb with shock.<br><br>The Allards ran from the house, clutching bottles of whiskey and brandy. Dimly, Mat heard their drunken shouts above the crackle of the flames. A long time later he fell asleep, remembering with horror the face of Cotton Allard, and of Tuleson, the one who had dropped from the balcony.<br><br>There under the roots Major James Brionne and Malvernia found Mat, curled up and asleep, on the following morning.<br><br><i>Chapter Two<br></i><br><br>Major James Brionne glanced across the table at his son.<br><br>"Make the most of this, Mat. Soon you'll have to put up with my cooking."<br><br>"I like your cooking, pa."<br><br>The boy was subdued, too much so. In the four months that had gone by since the death of his mother, Mat had been very quiet. He talked only when spoken to, asked no questions, but stayed right at his father's heels as if he feared to lose him too.<br><br>Little by little he had told the story of that night&#x2013; of his mother's quiet courage, of the awe-struck renegades; he had even told that last remark, heard as he hesitated briefly in the door, the remark made by Cotton Allard. "By the Lord Harry," Allard had said, "that there was a woman!"<br><br>But his words had come rarely, and Brionne had not tried to prod the boy into talking. There was no thought of returning to the estate the Major had loved so well. It was all too fresh in the boy's mind. What was needed was change, a complete and drastic change that would bring fresh interests, fresh demands.<br><br>"It is a lonely place to which we are going, Mat. We will see other people only when we go for supplies, but the town will be very small, I imagine."<br><br>James Brionne was a tall, wide-shouldered man of thirty-three, his face strongly boned, and darkened by sun and wind. He possessed that rare quality known as presence, and beneath it there was something else, for those who knew men of violence had a way of looking twice at James Brionne. Under the dignity, the poise, the military bearing there was something very tough and dangerous.<br><br>"We will be riding the steam cars, Mat. We will ride them for several days. You will be seeing a lot of new country."<br><br>"Will there be Indians?" Mat asked.<br><br>It was the first question, the first stir of interest he had shown.<br><br>"A few, I expect. I hope there will be no hostiles."<br><br>Suddenly a man in uniform was beside their table. "Major? The General is upstairs. He wishes to see you."</p><h2>The End of the Past: Ancient Rome and the Modern West (Revealing Antiquity)</h2><p><p> This searching interpretation of past and present addresses fundamental questions about the fall of the Roman Empire. Why did ancient culture, once so strong and rich, come to an end? Was it destroyed by weaknesses inherent in its nature? Or were mistakes made that could have been avoided--was there a point at which Greco-Roman society took a wrong turn? And in what ways is modern society different? </p><p> Western history is split into two discontinuous eras, Aldo Schiavone tells us: the ancient world was fundamentally different from the modern one. He locates the essential difference in a series of economic factors: a slave-based economy, relative lack of mechanization and technology, the dominance of agriculture over urban industry. Also crucial are aspects of the ancient mentality: disdain for manual work, a preference for transcending (rather than transforming) nature, a basic belief in the permanence of limits. </p><p> Schiavone's lively and provocative examination of the ancient world, "the eternal theater of history and power," offers a stimulating opportunity to view modern society in light of the experience of antiquity. </p></p><p><b>Aldo Schiavone</b> is Professor of Roman Law and Director of the Istituto Italiano di Scienze Umane.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/SCHEND_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Emmet&#39;s Guide to Being Awesome-r (The LEGO Movie 2)</h2><p><b>Let Emmet teach you how to be AWESOMER with his guide to life!Includes an exclusive Emmet Minifigure.</b> <b>THE LEGO MOVIE 2 - in cinemas February 2019!</b> JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET AWESOMER...

Sometimes Close makes the abstract units by inking his finger and pressing it on the canvas over and over. His way of working, as it developed from photorealism to his current unique style, with its relationship to computer art and photomechanical reproduction, is inherently interesting, while the way his portraits almost magically seem to emerge as one gets far enough away from the canvas is clearly shown in the excellent-quality full-color reproductions. Close's story is doubly inspiring, both for the discipline he has developed and for the importance in his life of friends and family. There is enough information for reports, but the book is engaging enough for pleasure reading. Also included are an essay, "What Is a Portrait?" illustrated with works by other artists; a bibliography (all adult titles); and a list of museums that have works by Close. Individual biographies of contemporary artists are still rather scarce. This one has more information than Mike Venezia's Jackson Pollock (1994) or Andy Warhol (1996, both Children's), and lacks the irreverent cartoons of those titles. Viewers will be instantly captured by the cover of this book, a detail of just the eyes and nose of one of Chuck Close's distinctive self-portraits.?Pam Gosner, formerly at Maplewood Memorial Library, NJ<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.On the heels of John Guare's biography for adult readers, Chuck Close: Life and Work 19881995 (1995)--which covers Close's work since 1988, when a collapsed spinal artery left Close paralyzed below the shoulders--comes a biography from Greenberg and Jordan (The American Eye, 1995, etc.) that profiles the artist's entire life. As a child, art rescued Close from the frustrations of learning disabilities that made school a struggle; he developed ``painstaking discipline'' that helped him paint later in life, even when physical disabilities threatened to end his career. As in their other collaborations, the authors meld the artist's biography with their readings of his art. Close's feelings for his friends are conveyed through his gargantuan portraits of them and his multiple interpretations of their photographs. Full-color illustrations show both finished works, and the processes through which they are made, including scenes of Close on the forklift he uses to move around the canvas. In closing with a chapter on the history of portraiture that compares Close's works to those of other painters, the volume captures both the originality of Close's artwork, and the steady gifts of its creator.

Finley</b> (1912-1986), the son of Nathan Finkelstein and Anna Katzellenbogen, was born in New York City. He graduated from Syracuse University at the age of fifteen and received an MA in public law from Columbia, before turning to the study of ancient history. During the thirties, Finley taught at Columbia and City College and developed an interest in the sociology of the ancient world that was shaped in part by his association with members of the Frankfurt School who were working in exile in America. In 1952, when he was teaching at Rutgers, Finley was summoned before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and asked whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. He refused to answer, invoking the Fifth Amendment; by the end of the year he had been fired from the university by a unanimous vote of its trustees. Unable to find work in the US, Finley moved to England, where he taught for many years at Cambridge, helping to redirect the focus of classical education from a narrow emphasis on philology to a wider concern with culture, economics, and society. He became a British subject in 1962 and was knighted in 1979.

His first novel, <em>Wait Until Spring</em>, Bandini, was published in 1938 and was the first of his Arturo Bandini series of novels, which also include <em>The Road to Los Angeles</em> and <em>Ask the Dust</em>. A prolific screenwriter, he was stricken with diabetes in 1955. Complications from the disease brought about his blindness in 1978 and, within two years, the amputation of both legs. He continued to write by dictation to his wife, Joyce, and published <em>Dreams from Bunker Hill</em>, the final installment of the Arturo Bandini series, in 1982. He died on May 8, 1983, at the age of seventy-four.</p>Fante, who died in 1983, is receiving some belated recognition for novels like Ask the Dust and Wait Until Spring, Bandini. His biographer, Stephen Cooper, has unearthed 18 previously uncollected stories that Fante wrote over 27 years, ranging from derivative and self-indulgent juvenilia to intelligent and meaningful tales of the immigrant experience. "Prologue to Ask the Dust" is essentially a pr cis of the novel, displaying a savage energy and sense of immediacy. This and several other stories bring the Los Angeles of some 60 years ago to life. In the memorable "Mary Osaka, I Love You," Filipino dishwasher Mingo Mateo falls in love with the daughter of his Japanese employer. Mingo's friends are violently opposed to the union, but Mingo and Mary argue that politics and race should not interfere with love. They elope to Las Vegas and marry on December 7, 1941. "Bus Ride" is another, tenser tale of interracial attraction, this time between a Filipino man and a European-American woman. Fante himself was Italian and there are several stories about Italian immigrants. A family in "The Bad Woman" unite to keep a son and brother from making what they believe is a bad marriage. "The Sins of the Mother" tells of a formidable matriarch who is determined that her beautiful daughter not marry a truck driver. Like many of the stories in the volume, this one echoes with understated passion, though the prose is calm and the dialogue polite.

As the first lightplane to be built en masse on an automobile-style production line and the first lightplane built with tricycle landing gear and a steerable nose-wheel. the Ercoupe was undoubtedly an important plane - one whose contributions to aviation and influence on aircraft design are still felt today. In The Ercoupe all the highlights of this classic airplane&#39;s history and numerous operational highlights are recalled, including riveting accounts of the Ercoupe&#39;s groundbreaking jet-assisted takeoff and the time a child with no pilot training took up an Ercoupe without incident. Adding to the book&#39;s value, Ercoupe designer and engineer Fred Weick granted the author complete access to his voluminous files, offered his personal recollections and observations, and wrote an enlightening Foreword for the book. With its unparalleled detail and impeccable sources The Ercoupe is an indispensable addition to the library of any classic aircraft enthusiast.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Wood Joinery</h2><p>Learn the joinery techniques that are essential to fine woodworking, including butt joints, dadoes and grooves, rabbet, miter, lap, mortise-tenon, edge-to-edge, dovetail, and many more.

Each double-page topic treatment covers many facets of everyday life, including food and its preparation, the role of the church, commerce, guilds, apprenticeship, and social customs. The contrast between the lives of the rich and the poor is described as well as the considerable impact on everyone of the plague, war, and famine. Other titles provide similiar information, but this one's format is unique. As in Clare's Classical Rome (HBJ, 1993), the book is heavily illustrated with full-color, often full-page photographs that feature costumed actors in appropriate settings. While a few are obviously posed, a bit too pristine, or at times static, the photos are of generally excellent quality, richly detailed, and artistically arranged. They are bound to appeal to readers, and thorough captions invite closer inspection. The chapter "How Do We Know?" examines sources of information and the problems of interpretation. Included is a map of Europe in 1360 and a useful timeline that sets this period amidst the events spanning from 4000 B. C. to the present. For a more expanded treatment, readers might consult Corbishley's The Middle Ages (Facts on File, 1990). Though helpful for reports, Clare's book will also circulate for recreational reading; the compelling photographs make it a good choice to introduce a unit on the subject. --Sylvia V.

This was the New York of Palladium; of Mars, Limelight, and Twilo; of unchecked, drug-fueled hedonism in pumping clubs where dance music was still largely underground, popular chiefly among working-class African Americans and Latinos. And then there was Moby&#x2014;not just a poor, skinny white kid from Connecticut, but a devout Christian, a vegan, and a teetotaler. He would learn what it was to be spat on, to live on almost nothing. But it was perhaps the last good time for an artist to live on nothing in New York City: the age of AIDS and crack but also of a defiantly festive cultural underworld. Not without drama, he found his way. But success was not uncomplicated; it led to wretched, if in hindsight sometimes hilarious, excess and proved all too fleeting. And so by the end of the decade, Moby contemplated an end in his career and elsewhere in his life, and put that emotion into what he assumed would be his swan song, his good-bye to all that, the album that would in fact be the beginning of an astonishing new phase: the multimillion-selling <i>Play</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> At once bighearted and remorseless in its excavation of a lost world, <i>Porcelain</i> is both a chronicle of a city and a time and a deeply intimate exploration of finding one&#x2019;s place during the most gloriously anxious period in life, when you&#x2019;re on your own, betting on yourself, but have no idea how the story ends, and so you live with the honest dread that you&#x2019;re one false step from being thrown out on your face. Moby&#x2019;s voice resonates with honesty, wit, and, above all, an unshakable passion for his music that steered him through some very rough seas.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Porcelain</i> is about making it, losing it, loving it, and hating it. It&#x2019;s about finding your people, your place, thinking you've lost them both, and then, somehow, when you think it&#x2019;s over, from a place of well-earned despair, creating a masterpiece. As a portrait of the young artist, <i>Porcelain</i> is a masterpiece in its own right, fit for the short shelf of musicians&#x2019; memoirs that capture not just a scene but an age, and something timeless about the human condition. Push play.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Moby</b>&nbsp;is a singer-songwriter, musician, DJ, and photographer. His records have sold 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic called him "one of the most important dance music figures of the early '90s." He lives in Los Angeles.&#x201c;A lovingly composed new memoir that tracks his journey from living in an abandoned factory in Connecticut to playing the hottest clubs in New York and Europe. ...<i>Porcelain </i>reads like an intimate meditation on the various contradictions Moby has resolved over the course of his 50 years: his Christian faith vs. his hedonistic streak; his hunger for stardom vs. his retiring nature; his respect for ambition vs. his deep belief in luck. The book is also a tender ode to a vanished New York City.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;As much a portrait of downtown Manhattan in the late &#x2018;80s and &#x2018;90s as it is an iconoclastic artist&#x2019;s coming-of-age story, this raucous, candid memoir will fascinate the electronic musician&#x2019;s many fans.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>People<br></i><br> &#x201c;<i>Porcelain</i> vividly evokes a certain place and time&#x2014;specifically, New York in the &#x2019;90s. It simultaneously presents a portrait of its author that&#x2019;s withering in the extreme. At the same time, it offers a perfect freeze-frame of downtown New York in the Dinkins to early Giuliani years, when far more of the cherished stench of &#x2019;70s and &#x2019;80s city lingered than some may remember.&#x201d;&#x2014;New York Observer<br><br> &#x201c;Riveting.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Rolling Stone</i><br><br>&#x201c;Rock memoirs rarely live up to expectations, but... <i>Porcelain</i> is an exception. It ranks with Kim Gordon's <i>Girl in a Band</i> and a handful of others in recent years as a particularly incisive look at not just a life in music, but at the cultural and social circumstances that helped shape it. It is by turns self-deprecating, hilarious and moving.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune<br></i><br> &#x201c;Moby&#x2019;s<i> Porcelain</i> is a buoyant coming-of-age story set in the filthy, dangerous New York City of the 1990s that the musician and DJ adored. Funny, bighearted and raw.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>&#x201c;Entertainingly gritty... A distinctive addition to the recent spate of well-written memoirs by contemporary musicians, a list that would include the likes of Elvis Costello, Patti Smith, and Carrie Brownstein.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;A love letter to chaotic 1990s New York...Moby&#x2019;s prose is honest, self-deprecating, and full of mordant wit, and when music is playing, it shines with exhilarating emotion.&#x201d;<i>&nbsp;&#x2014;Publishers Weekly, starred</i><br><br>&#x201c;Ten years of Moby&#x2019;s life, mostly in the decrepit, dangerous, much-loved New York City of the 1990s, a life comically overcrowded,&nbsp; filthy, alcohol-fuelled, vegan, unbelievably noisy, full of spit and semen and some sort of Christianity; and often, suddenly, moving. The writing is terrific, enlivened by a bewildered deadpan humor that makes crazy sense of it all. His ancestor Herman Melville would, I think, be simultaneously revolted and proud.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;</i>Salman Rushdie<br><br>&#x201c;Full disclosure: Moby is a friend of mine, yet I had no idea that he was such a brilliant writer and storyteller. <i>Porcelain</i>, to me, is a classic and beautifully told bildungsroman&#x2014;a young man comes to the city to find himself. And Moby tells this tale of his youth&#x2014;his search for meaning and music&#x2014;with gorgeous clarity, comedy, and compassion. <i>Porcelain</i> also serves as a history of downtown New York of a certain time, a New York that doesn't really exist anymore, but I was very happy to reencounter it here through Moby's particular and fascinating lens.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jonathan Ames, author of <i>Wake Up, Sir!</i> <br><br> &#x201c;This is one of the funniest and most accessible books you'll ever read about an erstwhile Christian/alcoholic vegan electronic music maker. Throughout the adventures and misadventures, Danish music festivals and Barbadan disasters, Moby manages to stay wide-eyed, grateful and amazed, which itself is a real gift to the reader: we feel welcome in&#x2014;or just as out of place as he feels&#x2014;in the world of rock and raves and clubs. He remakes the music world into the form it should be: nonexclusive, unpretentious, less about division and stratification, and more about radical inclusion. Music shouldn't exist any other way.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;</i>Dave Eggers<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Raw, honest, cruel and funny, Moby's beautifully-written memoir is a pure act of bravery. He allows us to ride on his shoulder as he chases a dream through New York nightlife and the European club scene, his self-deprecating humor and unguarded nature lulling us into believing the ride will be breezy and the landing soft. Only when he starts plummeting to earth do we realize that we&#x2019;ve left his shoulder and climbed into his head, where self-deprecation reveals itself as self-loathing that is chasing self-destruction. It&#x2019;s a dark place with jagged edges&#x2014;not the spot to ride out this kind of fall, and Moby hides not one shard of it from us. But, in perhaps in an even greater act of bravery, he also never hides behind cynicism, or distances himself from the hope, and even innocence, of his dreams. I wish my writing could be even half as honest.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;</i>Paul Haggis<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Honest, funny, and sometimes raw, Porcelain is an intimate look at a life in motion. It proves that Moby writes like he plays music&#x2013;with passion and precision and heart.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;</i>Susan Orlean</p><h2>Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man</h2><p>Recipient of the National Book Award for History and Biography (Nonfiction), David Herbert Donald&#39;s second volumne on Sumner is favorable but critical, and, recognizes his large contribution to the positive accomplishments of Reconstruction.

In <i>Memoirs of a Rugby-Playing Man</i>, bestselling author Jay Atkinson describes his thirty-five year odyssey in the sport-from his rough and rowdy days at the University of Florida, through the intrigue of various foreign tours, club championships, and all star selections, up to his current stint with the freewheeling Vandals Rugby Club out of Los Angeles. Jay has played in more than 500 matches, for which he's suffered three broken ribs, a detached retina, a fractured cheekbone and orbital bone, four deadened teeth, and a dislocated ankle. Written in the style of Siegried Sassoon's Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man, Atkinson's book explains why it was all worth it--the sum total of his violent adventures, and the valuable insights he has gained from them.</p></p><p><p>A former two-sport college athlete, Jay Atkinson is the author of seven books, including the bestsellers Legends of Winter Hill and Ice Time, as well as the classic rugby novel, Caveman Politics. He teaches writing at Boston University.</p>Chapter 1<br><b>The Vandals</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>A few months before Dr. Phillips screwed my ankle back together, I was at the Mardi Gras tournament in Louisiana playing for the Vandals. Fifteen minutes into our first match, the sky was low and dark as we spread across our goal line, waiting for their forwards to attack. The referee marked the spot and they ran a fake to the right, freezing the stiffest part of our defense, the heavyweights. Then their biggest player&#x2014;roughly half my age and twice my size&#x2014;charged straight at me as the scrumhalf flipped him the ball.</i><br><i>At 52, most guys are watching their kids play high school sports or riding in carts across the local golf course. But as the young behemoth tucked the ball under his arm and hurtled forward, I bit down on my mouthpiece and lowered my center of gravity and scrambled toward him. I didn&#x2019;t have any real thoughts, just an instinct to step into the gap. In rugby, you lace &#x2019;em up and take your chances.... </i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Five miles east of downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Independence Park is a vast, flatiron complex of athletic fields and jogging paths, with five rugby fields lined and laid out beside the main parking lot. That weekend, I was competing in the annual Mardi Gras Rugby Festival as part of the Vandals RFC, a team assembled by my old friend Frank Baker, an Associated Press editor in Los Angeles. Shortly before our first game, Baker announced the starting team and after pulling on the red and black Vandals jersey, I swigged from a gallon of water and set off at a jog, past the concession stands and the medical tent and a portable stereo playing zydeco music. In the stench from the local oil refineries, I ran along with the pancakes from breakfast leaping around in my stomach, trying to steady my heart rate and take the edge off the jitters.<br>If all sports are really about war, then rugby is an eighteenth-century epic of bayonet charges and hand-to-hand fighting. On an expanded football field without any yard lines, the teams line up facing each other like infantrymen wearing cleated boots. And every few minutes the combatants must steel themselves for a fresh assault into the teeth of the enemy. Faintheartedness is easy to spot: the player who shirks contact is hooted from the sidelines and often injured. I&#x2019;ve been playing rugby since Gerald Ford was president and these days I&#x2019;m the oldest guy on the Vandals roster, an invitational side made up of players from all over, many of whom are in their twenties and early thirties. Current Vandals hail from Ireland, Australia, Kenya, New Zealand, Uruguay, Cuba, Rhode Island, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, Florida, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. It&#x2019;s a pretty good club, one of the best I&#x2019;ve ever played for.<br>I hear the voices on occasion, saying that I&#x2019;m too old and too slow, my best rugby long gone. Certainly I have the responsibility of a career, a sixteen-year-old son who needs and deserves my attention, and a body that&#x2019;s intact but constantly on the verge of major breakdowns: ankles, knees, neck, hamstrings, upper back, and the rest. But rugby gives me something that I can&#x2019;t get anywhere else: the feeling that, while I&#x2019;m out there, I&#x2019;m living the truth. Sure, it&#x2019;s a young man&#x2019;s game, but that&#x2019;s no reason to surrender something you love. What compels my passion for rugby at this age is the dividend from grit: the months of training exchanged for one or two golden moments of performance.<br>After jogging half a mile, I stopped among some trees and pissed on a holly bush, coming out to a baseball diamond to stretch in the dust near home plate. Away in the distance I could see the rugby fields grouped together and the other Vandals moving back and forth in a red-shirted mass. Seven of this year&#x2019;s nineteen Vandals come from my home club, Amoskeag RFC of Manchester, New Hampshire. Then there&#x2019;s thirty-one-year-old Tom &#x201c;Reggae&#x201d; Rege, who was born in Kenya, and Lyle Jones, thirty-three, from Renova, Mississippi. My old college roommate Surfer John Hearin from Cocoa Beach, Florida, and Super Dave Laflamme of Rhode Island, and Spencer Cackett, a commercial deep-sea diver from Australia. Tennessean Daniel Carter, who talks about as fast as a possum does arithmetic, enjoys regaling us with stories about his hometown. &#x201c;In &#x2018;Sweet Lips&#x2019; you order food and they bring you gravy&#x2014;whether you want it or not,&#x201d; says Carter, who owns a coon-hunting mule named Festus.<br>But the undisputed chieftain of the Vandals is forty-two-year-old Frank Baker, the son of a newsman who&#x2019;s originally from Upstate New York. With his mobile features and white-blond hair, Baker looks like a younger and more rugged version of the actor Ed Begley, Jr., and was once a four-letter man for the Voorheesville High Blackbirds. A couple of times a year, he invites his favorite ruggers to join him under the banner of the Vandals, and players converge from various points to witness Baker&#x2019;s monumental place kicks and offbeat sense of humor.<br>Baker invented the Vandals back in 1995, when he was playing for Amoskeag, by combining our sturdy pack of forwards with Providence RFC&#x2019;s shifty backline, which produced a tournament victory in Portland, Maine. (I didn&#x2019;t play in that first game, but I&#x2019;ve played for the Vandals on just about every trip since.) The idea caught on and soon, excellent rugby players with exceptional social skills&#x2014;funny, charismatic guys that Baker had encountered over the years&#x2014;were clamoring for a Vandals&#x2019; invitation. As he roamed the country in various assignments for the Associated Press, he added ruggers from the Deep South, Washington, D.C., and California and Colorado to the mix. It was a perfect rugby storm for me: high-level tournament competition two or three times a year, with representative level players who didn&#x2019;t take themselves too seriously and loved to have a good time. I&#x2019;d tried Old Boys rugby with various over-thirty-five and over-forty teams and it wasn&#x2019;t for me. Fat guys huffing and puffing around the field, sloppy play, and bad jokes; nothing like the kinetic, forward-driven rugby I&#x2019;d always thrived on. And just when you caught on to the joke and relaxed, some 230-pound moron would knock you senseless. Fuck that.<br>Even in a public place, a rugby team is a closed society, talking in a kind of shorthand that outsiders are never privy to. On this particular trip, several of the Vandals visited Bourbon Street in New Orleans and as we proceeded among the masked revelers and funky, pie-eyed tourists, Baker jerked his hand upward, pointing to a middle-aged woman on a balcony overhead. She had a cup of beer in her hand and a pair of red plastic horns attached to her head.<br>&#x201c;A housewife from Ohio is, in fact, the devil,&#x201d; said Baker.<br>&#x201c;Get behind me, Mrs. Satan,&#x201d; I said, as we went past.<br>Minutes before the opening kickoff, I joined the other Vandals beneath the goalposts with a sense of mortal dread running through my veins. There&#x2019;s a fair chance you&#x2019;ll get hurt or maimed in a rugby game, and a remote possibility you&#x2019;ll be killed. Over my career, I&#x2019;ve known three very athletic guys who ended up in wheelchairs and before every game I kneel down, make the sign of the cross and whisper, &#x201c;Dear Lord, please keep me, my teammates and our opponents free from injury and help me play to the best of my ability, as a glory to God. Amen.&#x201d;<br>Being in a scrum, especially right up front&#x2014;at hooker, where I play&#x2014;is particularly dangerous. The two packs line up a yard apart, a total of eight men on each side intricately bound together with three men forming the front row, the hooker in the middle. When the referee shouts, &#x201c;Ready. <i>En-gage!</i>&#x201d; and sixteen guys collide with the thump of bone on bone, there is absolutely no way to remain half interested in what&#x2019;s happening. As soon as the scrumhalf puts the ball into the tunnel between the two sets of forwards, it&#x2019;s my job to hook the ball back with my foot, at the right speed and in the right part of the tunnel, so our scrumhalf can get it out to the backs. Once the two packs come together at that velocity and with that much force, the joy of risk crowds out the dread.<br>The two props&#x2014;the Argentines call them <i>pilars</i>&#x2014;are expected to protect the hooker no matter what. That weekend in Louisiana, I was playing between two longtime teammates from New Hampshire. Butch McCarthy, six foot one, 285 pounds, is a former Plymouth State College Academic All-American in football who lives by the credo: <i>high intensity, short duration</i>. Like-sized Fred Roedel played football and rugby at Norwich University and has the on-field temperament of an enraged moose. I&#x2019;m five foot nine, 165 pounds and for the past twenty-three years, I&#x2019;ve trusted life and limb to Freddie and Butch. In the scrums, we hang on and squeeze until our fingernails bleed.<br>Our first match was against a team of buzz-cutted navy flyers from Pensacola, Florida, who won their preliminary game by a score of 67&#x2013;0. They kicked off and Bill Bishop caught the ball and the onrushing Pensacola boys hit the breakdown and we all went down in a heap. In rugby, the area surrounding you is exaggeratedly clear, absent of sound and slow moving like syrup. Outside that circle everything whips past at incredible speeds. The game moves with the quickness of thought, the ball spun from player to player, suddenly appearing in your hands. Decisions are made on the crest of an instant&#x2014;run with it, pass it, take a tackle or go to the ground&#x2014;and mistakes bring that blurry violence right to you.<br>The first few scrums of the Pensacola games were tight and breathless; all I can really think about is doing my job, executing the skills I&#x2019;ve acquired over the years in precise little steps. I&#x2019;m not a star, and never have been; I know ...</p><h2>Mortal Danger (The Immortal Game, 1)</h2><p><p>Revenge is a dish best served cold.</p><p>In Ann Aguirre's <i>Mortal Danger</i>, Edie Kramer has a score to settle with the beautiful people at Blackbriar Academy.

First I read up on the best ways to do it, then I learned the warning signs and made sure not to reveal any of them. People who wanted to be saved gave away their possessions and said their good-byes. I&#x2019;d passed so far beyond that point; I just wanted it all to stop.</p> <p>There was no light at the end of this tunnel.</p> <p>So two days after the school year ended, I left my house for what I intended to be the last time. I wrote no note of explanation. In my opinion, it never offered closure and it only made the survivors feel guilty. Better to let my parents think I suffered from some undiagnosed mental illness than to have them carry the knowledge that maybe they could&#x2019;ve saved me; that burden could drive my parents to the ledge behind me, and I didn&#x2019;t want that. I only wanted an ending.</p> <p>Earlier I had walked toward the BU T station I used for other errands, like shopping and school. There was plenty of time for me to change my mind, but I&#x2019;d done all the research, and it was meticulous. I&#x2019;d considered all sorts of methods, but in the end, I preferred water because it would be tidy and quick. I hated the idea of leaving a mess at home for my parents to clean up. This early&#x2014;or late, depending on your perspective&#x2014;the city was relatively quiet. <i>Just as well.</i> I&#x2019;d gotten off at North Station and trudged the last mile or so.</p> <p>Jumpers loved this place, but if you picked the wrong time, somebody would notice, call the authorities, and then you&#x2019;d have cars honking, lanes shutting down, police cars&nbsp;&#x2026; pretty much the whole media circus. I was smart enough to choose my opportunity carefully; in fact, I&#x2019;d studied the success stories and compared the times when the most deaths occurred. Constrained by public transport hours, I arrived a bit later than the majority of those who died here, but my leap would still be feasible.</p> <p>At this hour, there wasn&#x2019;t as much traffic. The bridge was a monster, but I didn&#x2019;t have to go all the way to the other side. Predawn murk threw shadows over the metal pylons as I faced my fate. I felt nothing in particular. No joy, but no sadness either.</p> <p>The last three years had been the worst. I&#x2019;d seen the well-meant <i>It Gets Better</i> videos, but I wasn&#x2019;t tough enough to make it through another year, when there was no assurance college would be better. The constant jokes, endless harrassment&#x2014;if this was all I could look forward to, then I was ready to check out. I didn&#x2019;t know why people at school hated me so much. To my knowledge, I&#x2019;d never done anything except exist, but that was enough. At Blackbriar Academy&#x2014;an expensive, private school that my parents thought guaranteed a bright future&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t okay to be ugly, weird, or different. I was all of the above. And not in the movie way, either, where the geek girl took down her hair and swapped her horn rims for contacts, then suddenly, she was a hottie.</p> <p>When I was little, it didn&#x2019;t bother me. But the older I got, the meaner the kids became, particularly the beautiful ones. To get in with their crowd, you needed a certain look, and money didn&#x2019;t hurt. Teachers fell in with whatever the Teflon crew told them, and most adults had enough secret cruelty to believe somebody like me had it coming&#x2014;that if I tried harder, I could stop stuttering, get a nose job, dye my hair, and join a gym. So clearly it was my fault that I&#x2019;d rather read than try to bring myself up to the standards of people I hated.</p> <p>Over the years, the pranks got worse and worse. They stole my clothes from my gym locker, so I had to go to class all stinky in my PE uniform. Not a day went by that they didn&#x2019;t do something, even as simple as a kick or a shove or a word that dug deep as a knife. I used to tell myself I could survive it&#x2014;I quoted Nietzsche in my head and I pretended I was a fearless heroine. But I was as strong as my tormentors could make me, and it wasn&#x2019;t enough. Four months ago, the last day before winter break, they broke me.</p> <p>I pushed the memory down like the bile I swallowed on a daily basis. The shame was the worst, as if I&#x2019;d done something to deserve this. Being smart and ugly wasn&#x2019;t reason enough for what they did to me. Nothing was. At that point, I implemented plan B. I had no friends. Nobody would miss me. At best, my parents&#x2014;oblivious academic types&#x2014;would see me as ruined potential. Sometimes I thought they had me as a sociology experiment. Afterward, they&#x2019;d retrieve my body and mark my file with a big red FAIL stamp.</p> <p>The sky was gray and pearly, mist hanging over the river. Drawing in a deep breath, I gathered my courage. To my amusement, I&#x2019;d passed a sign that read, DEPRESSED? CALL US. Then it listed a number. I&#x2019;d ignored that, along with a massive heap of pigeon shit, and continued across until I was far enough out that the water would drown me fast, provided the fall didn&#x2019;t kill me on impact. Now I only had to climb over quietly and let go.</p> <p><i>The end.</i></p> <p>A jagged shard tore loose in my chest; tears burned in my eyes. <i>Why didn&#x2019;t anyone notice? Why didn&#x2019;t anyone</i> do <i>anything?</i> So, maybe I was like the other lost souls, after all. I wanted a hand on my shoulder, somebody to stop me. Shaking, I put my foot on the guardrail and swung my leg over. On the other side, metal at my back, the dark river spread before me as if it led to the underworld. For me, it did. My muscles coiled, but I didn&#x2019;t need to jump. All I had to do was lean into space. There would be a few seconds of freefall, and then I&#x2019;d hit the water. If the impact didn&#x2019;t kill me, the stones in my pockets would.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d planned for all contingencies.</p> <p>I stepped forward.</p> <p>A hand on my shoulder stopped me. The touch radiated heat, shocking me nearly to death. I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time anyone had touched me, except to hurt. My parents weren&#x2019;t huggers. So long as I got straight As, they had little to do with me. They said they were rearing me to be self-sufficient. It felt more like they were raising me to self-destruct.</p> <p><i>Mission accomplished.</i></p> <p>I turned, expecting a corporate drone jonesing to start his cubicle time early, and on target to screw up my careful plans. In that case, I&#x2019;d have to talk fast to avoid police involvement and incarceration in a mental facility. They&#x2019;d put me on death watch and stare at me for three days in case I relapsed with the urge to kill myself. The lie hovered on the tip of my tongue&#x2014;how I was researching suicide to make a sociology essay more compelling&#x2014;but the guy who&#x2019;d interrupted my exit also stole my ability to form a coherent thought. His hand remained on my shoulder, steadying me, but he didn&#x2019;t speak.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t either.</p> <p>I couldn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>He had the kind of face you saw in magazines, sculpted and airbrushed to perfection. Sharp cheekbones eased into a strong jaw and a kissable mouth. His chin was just firm enough. He had a long, aquiline nose and jade eyes with a feline slant. His face was&nbsp;&#x2026; haunting, unsettling, even. His layered mop of dark hair gained coppery streaks in the halo of passing headlights that limned us both. In a minute or two, somebody would see us. Though traffic was light, it wasn&#x2019;t nonexistent, and eventually some concerned motorist would pull over or make a call. I saw my window of opportunity narrowing.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I managed to get the word out without stammering.</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to do this. There are other options.&#x201d;</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t try to bullshit. His direct, gold-sparked gaze made me feel that would be a waste of time. Part of me thought I might have already jumped, and he was my afterlife. Or maybe I was on a ventilator after they fished me out of the river, which made this a coma dream. I&#x2019;d read studies where doctors posited that people experienced incredibly vivid dreamscapes during catatonia.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah? Like what?&#x201d;</p> <p>I figured he&#x2019;d mention therapy. Group sessions. Medication. Anything to get my butt off this bridge. Right then, only the strength of his biceps kept me from flinging myself backward. Well, that&nbsp;&#x2026; and curiosity.</p> <p>&#x201c;You can let me help you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how that&#x2019;s possible.&#x201d; My tone sounded bleak, and it gave away more than I wanted.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t mean to tell a random stranger my problems, no matter how pretty he was. In fact, that appeal made me trust him less. Beautiful people treated me well only when they were setting me up for something worse. In hindsight, I should&#x2019;ve been wary that day, but I was just so tired, and I wanted so bad to believe they intended to stop tormenting me. I was ready to accept the apology and move on. <i>Everybody grows up, right?</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the deal. We&#x2019;ll get something to drink, and I&#x2019;ll make my proposal. If you don&#x2019;t like what you hear, I&#x2019;ll escort you back here and this time, I won&#x2019;t stop you. I&#x2019;ll even stand guard so nobody else does.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why should I? You could be a murdering weirdo.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You intended to kill yourself anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I was going to be quick. You might not be. Being suicidal doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m stupid.&#x201d;</p> <p>He laughed. &#x201c;See, this is why I didn&#x2019;t bring my car. I <i>knew</i> you wouldn&#x2019;t get in.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>Weird.</i> That sounded like we were old friends, but I&#x2019;d remember someone like him. &#x201c;You got that right.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can walk five feet behind me if it makes you feel better.&#x201d;</p> <p>I wasn&#x2019;t sure it did, but with his help, I climbed back over the guardrail. His argument made sense, and I was curious. What did I have to lose? He might try to recruit me into a cult. Nervous and wary, I trudged behind him, my eyes on his back at all times. I was ready to end things on my terms, not wind up living in a hole in somebody&#x2019;s basement. That would definitely be worse. I shivered, wondering if this was the best idea. Yet curiosity refused to let me back out.</p> <p>He led the way off the bridge, quite a long walk the second time around; the rocks in my pockets gained weight with each step. Eventually, we reached the street, passing a number of closed restaurants, Italian places mostly. He stopped at a twenty-four-hour diner called Cuppa Joe. The place had a giant mug out front, outlined in red neon. Inside, the vinyl booths were cracked and sealed over with silver duct tape. On the wall, a neon blue-and-pink clock buzzed, a low drone just inside my range of hearing. According to the position of the hands, it was 6:05 a.m., and I&#x2019;d missed my deadline.</p> <p>A couple of waitresses wore the ultimate in polyester chic, while old women sat nursing coffee with lipstick imprints on chipped cups, makeup caked into their wrinkles. There were elderly couples as well; men in plaid trousers and white belts, ladies in shirtwaists. Everyone in the diner had an odd look, like they were players on a set, and some otherworldly director was saying, <i>Now</i> this <i>is what a diner looked like in 1955.</i> I also counted too many customers for this hour. Finally, there was an expectant air, as if they had all been awaiting our arrival. I dismissed the thought as symptomatic of how surreal the day had become.</p> <p>The hot samaritan sat down next to the window, so that the red light from the giant coffee cup on the roof fell across the table in waves. I took a seat opposite him and folded my hands like I was at a college admissions interview. He smiled at me. Under fluorescent lights, he was even better looking than he&#x2019;d appeared on the bridge.</p> <p>It didn&#x2019;t make me happy.</p> <p>&#x201c;So is this where you call the cops? You lured me in quietly. Good job.&#x201d; To my astonishment, I got the words out without a hitch. In his company, I wasn&#x2019;t nervous at all, mostly because I half suspected he was a figment of my imagination.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, this is where I introduce myself. I&#x2019;m Kian.&#x201d;</p> <p>Okay, not what I expected. &#x201c;Edie.&#x201d;</p> <p>Short for Edith, who had been my maternal great-aunt. No one used my nickname, except me&#x2014;in my head. At school, they called me Eat-it.</p> <p>&#x201c;I know who you are.&#x201d;</p> <p>My breath caught. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t find you by accident.&#x201d; Before I could answer, Kian signaled the waitress and ordered coffee.</p> <p>She glanced at me with an inquiring expression. <i>What the hell.</i> If I was dying after this conversation anyway&#x2014;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a strawberry milk shake.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, Hal,&#x201d; the waitress called. &#x201c;Shake one in the hay.&#x201d;</p> <p>An assenting noise came from the back and then the woman went behind the counter to pour Kian&#x2019;s coffee. She served it with a flourish, along with a sugar bowl and a pitcher of cream. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you take it, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>He smiled up at her. &#x201c;Good memory, Shirl.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I get the big bucks.&#x201d; She winked and sauntered to her next table.</p> <p>I picked up the thread as he stirred cream and sugar into his drink. &#x201c;Explain how you know who I am and where to find me. It sounds stalker-y, and I&#x2019;m inclined to bail as soon as I finish my shake.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then I have time to make my case,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;Misery leaves a mark on the world, Edie. All strong emotions do. Rage, terror, love, longing&nbsp;&#x2026; they&#x2019;re powerful forces.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right. What does that have to do with me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your pain came to my attention months ago. I&#x2019;m sorry it took me so long to act, but I&#x2019;m constrained by certain rules. I had to wait until you reached the breaking point before I could offer you a deal.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If this is where you offer a fiddle of gold against my soul, I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d;</p> <p>His smile flashed. A little shiver of warmth went through me because he seemed to appreciate my wit. &#x201c;Nothing so permanent.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all ears,&#x201d; I said as the waitress delivered my shake, hand-dipped with whorls of fresh whipped cream and a bright red cherry on top&#x2014;almost too pretty to drink. Deliberately, I stirred it with my straw, ruining the beauty, and sucked up a huge mouthful.</p> <p><i>Delicious.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;When humans of exceptional potential reach the breaking point&#x2014;what we call extremis&#x2014;we can step in.&#x201d;</p> <p>I choked on my drink. &#x201c;Humans. Which makes you <i>what</i>, exactly?&#x201d;</p> <p>Now I felt sure this was the lead-in to the most spectacular punk ever. I craned my neck, looking for Cameron, Brittany, Jen, Allison, or the cheer mascot, Davina. She had too much melanin for Blackbriar squad standards, so they kept her in a lion costume half the school year, and when she got out of it, she ran errands for the Teflon crew, who treated her more like a minion than a friend. I didn&#x2019;t see anyone from school, but that didn&#x2019;t mean they weren&#x2019;t in somebody&#x2019;s bedroom, laughing their asses off through this guy&#x2019;s button cam. This would probably end up on YouTube.</p> <p><i>Like the first video.</i></p> <p>Kian shook his head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t answer that unless we come to an agreement.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s cut to the chase,&#x201d; I said tiredly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re paying you, if you&#x2019;re a struggling actor, or what, but I&#x2019;m not interested. This isn&#x2019;t even the meanest prank they&#x2019;ve pulled. Are they watching right now?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Edie&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I cut in. &#x201c;I bet you don&#x2019;t get paid unless I play along. Fine. Tell me more about this awesome deal. Can I get it for four low payments of nine ninety-five?&#x201d;</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t answer. Instead, he leaned across the table and took my hand. <i>Now that&#x2019;s commitment to the bit,</i> I thought.</p> <p>Then the world vanished, a static skip in an old VCR tape. I remembered those from elementary school, the low-rent one I attended before my parents published, filed their first patent, and could afford a pricey prep school. That fast, the diner was just <i>gone</i>.</p> <p>Brutal wind whipped my hair against my face. My glasses frosted over and my skin tightened with goose bumps in the icy air. A mountain stared back at me, rocky and wild. If I took four steps forward, I&#x2019;d pitch off the edge. Vertigo spun my head, ...</p></p><h2>Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist (Working Class in American History)</h2><p>Traces the life of the controversial American socialist and social reformer and assesses his role in American history</p><p>Eugene Victor Debs was one of the most prominent labor activists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was, perhaps, the most admired openly radical public figure in America's history, running for president on the Socialist ticket in five separate elections, including a 1920 campaign conducted from prison. In the 1912 election, he earned 6 percent of the popular vote (and probably would have gotten more were it not for Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose campaign, which was also running on reform sentiments). Yet today he is largely forgotten, at best a footnote in history texts.<p> This biography by Professor Nick Salvatore does much to remedy the situation. It is a richly detailed recounting of Debs's life which demonstrates that Debs fit within a historical tradition of dissent in American politics. Although a professed socialist, he never gave up his commitment to democratic ideals; instead, he added to them an awareness of class and the effects of corporate capitalism that has continued relevance today.</p>Nick Salvatore is Maurice and Hinda Neufeld Founders Professor of Industrial and Labor Relations and a professor of American studies at Cornell University. He is the author of <i>We All Got History: The Memory Books of Amos Webber</i> and oher books.

G. Sebald)</strong></p> Combining fact and fiction, each of the one hundred and two tales of Alexander Kluge&#x2019;s <em>Temple of the Scapegoat</em> (dotted with photos of famous operas and their stars) compresses a lifetime of feeling and thought: Kluge is deeply engaged with the opera and an inventive wellspring of narrative notions. The titles of his stories suggest his many turns of mind: &#x201c;Total Commitment,&#x201d; &#x201c;Freedom,&#x201d; &#x201c;Reality Outrivals Theater,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Correct Slowing-Down at the Transitional Point Between Terror and an Inkling of Freedom,&#x201d; &#x201c;A Crucial Character (Among Persons None of Whom Are Who They Think They Are),&#x201d; and &#x201c;Deadly Vocal Power vs. Generosity in Opera.&#x201d; An opera, Kluge says, is a blast furnace of the soul, telling of the great singer Leonard Warren who died onstage, having literally sung his heart out. Kluge introduces a Tibetan scholar who realizes that opera &#x201c;is about comprehension and passion. The two never go together. Passion overwhelms comprehension. Comprehension kills passion. This appears to be the essence of all operas, says Huang Tse-we.&#x201d; He also comes to understand that female roles face the harshest fates: &#x201c;Compared to the mass of soprano victims (out of 86,000 operas, 64,000 end with the death of the soprano), the sacrifice of tenors is small (out of 86,000 operas 1,143 tenors are a write-off).&#x201d;</p><p><p><strong>Alexander Kluge</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>born in Germany in 1932, is a world-famous author and filmmaker (his twenty-three films include <em>Yesterday Girl</em>, <em>The Female Patriot</em>, <em>The Candidate</em>), a lawyer, and a media magnate.

And what defeats it? How do you lose it and how do you get it back? In this exuberant and compelling book, Gregg Levoy, best-selling author of <b><i>Callings</i></b>, explores how you can cultivate not just a specific passion, but passion as a mindset---a <i>stance</i>---that helps bring vitality to all your engagements, from work and relationships to creativity and spiritual life.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Vital Signs</i></b> examines the endless, yet endlessly fruitful, tug-of-war between passion and security in our lives, the wild in us and the tame, our natural selves and our conditioned selves, and shows us how to stay engaged with the world and resist the downward-pulling forces that can drain our aliveness.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Vital Signs</i></b> also encourages courageous inquiry into our <i>dis</i>-passion---where we&#x2019;re numb, depressed, stuck and bored in our lives---so that we can rework these tendencies in ourselves and claim our rightful inheritance of vitality.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you&#x2019;ll learn:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � Passion can be cultivated. Turned on as well as turned off. And this happens most readily at the level of the gesture and the moment, not the five-year plan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � Passion is in the risk. In the willingness to step from the sidelines onto the playing field.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � Passion breeds passion and disinterest breeds disinterest. If you lack passion in your life, your other relationships---your partnerships, friendships, communities, classrooms, corporations and congregations---will be denied that energy. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � Passion is more than exuberance; it's <i>endurance</i>. It's sometimes shoulder-to-the-wheel stamina and patience on the order of years.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � Passion is intimately related to health. To the degree that passion is vitality, honoring your passions enhances your vitality.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing from centuries of history, art, science, psychology and philosophy, as well as in-depth interviews with people who rediscovered and reignited passion in their own lives, <b><i>Vital Signs </i></b>offers an expansive menu of possibilities for how to claim and reclaim your passion, and will help you maintain a keen awareness of where the pulse is and a determination to plug into that place.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Gregg Levoy, </b>author of <i>Callings: Finding and Following an Authentic Life</i> is a former columnist and reporter for <i>USA Today</i> and the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, and has written for the<i> New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Psychology Today</i>, <i>American Health</i>, and others.

So the only way to stay up there was to remain extremely flappable, otherwise I&#x2019;d have been thrown, and it was probably ten to fifteen feet to the ground&#x2014;a concern that, to be honest, <i>paled</i> in comparison with my concern about how stupid I looked up there, desperately hanging on to this animal&#x2019;s buffeting ears, wearing my business clothes, because the animal trainer had sprung this brilliant idea on me right before the parade, and with my pants scrunched up <i>above</i> my knees.</p><p>I was the first thing anybody saw in that parade, and I&#x2019;m fairly certain I did not capture the theme of &#x201c;The Greatest Show on Earth.&#x201d;</p><p>But in looking back on my elephant ride, and on what I&#x2019;ve learned since then about what&#x2019;s involved in living passionately and courageously, that experience had a lot in common with the experience of following passions&#x2014;in that I was caught by surprise and carried off by something much bigger than me; in that it was nerve-racking and thrilling simultaneously; and in that the elephant couldn&#x2019;t have cared less. By which I mean that I&#x2019;ve discovered an unsettling truth: my soul doesn&#x2019;t seem to care what price I have to pay to live passionately.</p><p>This seems like a design flaw to me. But my security, my popularity, my vanity, even my happiness don&#x2019;t seem to matter to my soul. It&#x2019;s not interested in whether I live a comfortable life. It&#x2019;s not interested in making me rich or famous. It&#x2019;s not interested in whether people even like me or not. What <i>does</i> seem to matter to it, though, is staying up on the elephant and being willing to go for the Ride&#x2014;the one that ensures that someday if my life flashes in front of my eyes, it will at least hold my interest.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>PASSION IS WHAT DISTURBS and confounds the safe and settled in your life, the tendency to try to lock yourself into geosynchronous orbit around some form of security, no amount of which will ever adequately compensate you for giving up your passions or selling your soul, though it may allow you to suffer in nicer surroundings.</p><p>Passion is the impulse toward growth, which, by its nature, protests boredom and ennui, refuses to bump mindlessly along on the conveyor belt, and has little patience for the &#x201c;been there, done that&#x201d; attitude that there&#x2019;s nothing new under the sun. It&#x2019;s what stirs your interest in life, helping you awaken from the trances and entrapments of the everyday, which block the natural migration of your energies.</p><p>Whether passion takes the form of colorful intensity or contemplative alertness, it contributes to a vibrant life, a keen awareness of where the pulse is, and a determination to plug into that place. It helps you stay engaged with the world and enjoy it as a function of the primary calling of <i>all</i> creatures&#x2014;maximum aliveness.</p><p>In fact, passion is a survival mechanism, because your attachment to life depends on your interest in it, your sense of wonder and reverence, enthusiasm and gratitude, <i>participation</i>. It also depends on your ability to resist the torpor of dailiness, with its hypnotic routines and its soothing illusion that there&#x2019;s always tomorrow&#x2014;a lamp of Aladdin merely awaiting your caress&#x2014;and that you have plenty of time to make your dreams come true and your passions come alive, even though years may continue to slip by Rip Van Winkle&#x2013;like and you occasionally awaken with a growing uneasiness and a sense of being unrecognizable even to yourself.</p><p>Part of the reason so many people are fascinated nowadays with vampires and zombies is our collective fear of being sucked of our life force, drained of our vitalities, and left in a bloodless and catatonic state.</p><p>This fear may not be so much one of dying, or even being eaten alive, as much as one of being turned <i>into</i> a zombie. And most of us know, or have known, the experience of feeling like the living dead. Being at a job that, like a vampire, sucks the life out of you. School years spent staring zombielike into space and dreaming about the pleasures of the flesh or perhaps about freedom. Evenings spent clocking your statutory 4.8 hours of daily television. Being in a relationship in which you feel like a mere ghost of your full vital self. Long, dull stretches of life through which you&#x2019;ve staggered like the walking dead. And most of us also know the fear of losing our minds and our identities that can come with simply growing old and suffering dementia. Given enough time, life itself devours our brains.</p><p>But even if we haven&#x2019;t sent out a new shoot in years, or haven&#x2019;t strayed much beyond the cadaverous light of the television and computer, the hunger for passion reminds us that we&#x2019;re still vivid with life force, our souls shouting at the turned backs of resignation and boredom and time being torn off the calendar unused.</p><p>Just as there are parts of us we put to sleep over the course of life&#x2014;passions ignored, pleasures denied, emotions censored, powers hidden&#x2014;there&#x2019;s another part that wants to bend down and kiss our sleeping selves awake.</p><p>During the aerial bombing of London in World War II, damage to the Natural History Museum allowed light and moisture to enter the buildings, and mimosa seeds that had been brought over from China in 1793 and stashed in wooden collection cases suddenly awoke from their 150-year sleep and began sprouting. We, too, are revivable. No matter how long or deep the sleep, the soul is always willing to awaken.</p><p>Granted, the work of coming-to is formidable, whether individually or collectively. A lot of people feel deeply disengaged from life, from themselves, and from a sense of purpose or passion. A 2012 Gallup poll of employees in 142 countries found that, on average, 87 percent of them are either &#x201c;not engaged&#x201d; or &#x201c;actively disengaged&#x201d; (63 percent and 24 percent, respectively), and only 13 percent were &#x201c;engaged.&#x201d; In the United States alone, this adds up to roughly $550 billion a year in lost productivity.</p><p>Passion equals productivity, and lack of passion sabotages it, and that goes for both work and non-work modes of expression&#x2014;which makes you wonder what the engagement/disengagement figures would be on school life, family life, social life, and spiritual life. &#x201c;While complying can be an effective strategy for physical survival,&#x201d; says Daniel Pink in <i>Drive</i>, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a lousy one for personal fulfillment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not engaged&#x201d; means you&#x2019;re checked out, but &#x201c;actively disengaged&#x201d; means you&#x2019;re busy acting out your unhappiness and dispiritedness, spreading the virus among your colleagues, family, and friends, to say nothing of the body politic of which you&#x2019;re a cell. What it means, as one business columnist puts it, is that if you&#x2019;re part of a rowing team out on a river, one of the team members is rowing his or her heart out, five are just taking in the scenery, and two are actively trying to sink the boat.</p><p>But while dispassion is contagious, passion is equally catching. Some years ago, I was invited to facilitate one of my Callings workshops (based on my last book, <i>Callings</i>) for the environmental organization Earthstewards Network. As I was unpacking my car in the parking lot before the workshop began, a man pulled in, parked his car, got out, and motioned me over. He told me that he&#x2019;d taken one of my workshops a year before and wanted to share with me the passion that had emerged for him as a result. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to start my car,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and I want you to bend down and smell the exhaust.&#x201d;</p><p>This was certainly among the stranger requests I&#x2019;ve had in my time, but the exhaust that came out of the back of that fellow&#x2019;s car smelled exactly like a McDonald&#x2019;s. He explained that he&#x2019;d recently invented a process capable of turning used french fry oil into nonpolluting fuel for automobiles. In fact, he called it &#x201c;McFuel.&#x201d; And he was about to embark on a one-year pilgrimage driving his car around the country to drum up media attention for his new breakthrough, which, needless to say, relies on an abundant and renewable resource.</p><p>It reminded me that people&#x2014;their enthusiasm and ingenuity&#x2014;are amazing and that you never know who&#x2019;s watching you. One person&#x2019;s passion can have a profound effect on the unfolding of another person&#x2019;s passion, without the first person even being aware of it. So, it thus matters greatly that every one of us is out there doing our proverbial thing and expressing our passion for life, interconnectedness being what it is, the Web being what it is, the mechanics of inspiration being what they are.</p><p>This certainly goes for anyone in a position of leadership or stewardship, especially relative to children and young adults. Whether you&#x2019;re a parent, teacher, minister, mentor, manager, coach, counselor, politician, or CEO, this much is certain: <i>your</i> passion is critical to <i>their</i> engagement.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a reason some of the world&#x2019;s great stories, like Sleeping Beauty and King Arthur and the Holy Grail&#x2014;of which there are versions all over the world&#x2014;speak to the idea that when the king or queen sleeps, those around them also sleep, and the kingdom sleeps. But when the king and queen awaken, those around them also awaken, and the kingdom begins to flower. It&#x2019;s an idea embedded very deeply into the mythologies, and thus the psychologies and philosophies, of the world, and what it tells us is that our individual work is also the work of the world, and that when we insist on our own aliveness, we stake a claim for everyone&#x2019;s.</p><p>Among my favorite stories from the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez is the story of a man trying to solve the world&#x2019;s problems. His young son comes into the room and asks if he can help. Touched by his son&#x2019;s concern but impatient to get on with his task, the man takes a map of the world, rips it into little pieces, and gives it to the boy, telling him that he can help by piecing the world back together. The boy doesn&#x2019;t have a clue what the world looks like, but he takes the pile of paper off to his room.</p><p>Two days later, he rushes into his father&#x2019;s study. &#x201c;Father! I&#x2019;ve put the world back together.&#x201d; And indeed the shreds of paper have been meticulously taped together. His father is stunned and asks how he did it. The boy turns the map over and says, &#x201c;On the back was a picture of a person, Father. I put the person back together and then turned it over and the world was back together!&#x201d;</p><p><i>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</i></p><p><i>VITAL SIGNS</i> is about what inspires passion and what defeats it. How you lose it and how you get it back. And ultimately it&#x2019;s about the endless yet endlessly fruitful tug-of-war between passion and security, the wild in you and the tame, your natural self and your conditioned self.</p><p>My prior book, <i>Callings</i>, is primarily about finding your vocational passion, and <i>Vital Signs</i> expands that exploration into the art of <i>living</i> passionately in all arenas of life&#x2014;adventure and discovery, creativity and self-expression, relationships, service, and spirituality. While <i>Callings</i> is geared to <i>doing</i> what you love, <i>Vital Signs</i> is geared to <i>being</i> in love with life. Not just attaining <i>a</i> passion, but cultivating the <i>skill</i> of passion. Not just passion as a place you get <i>to</i>, but a place you come <i>from</i>.</p><p><i>Vital Signs</i> also speaks to those who&#x2019;ve been living through years of a Great Recession and a Code Orange world, which has driven many people to batten their hatches and hunker down. Those stresses highlight the many downward-pulling forces of everyday life that can siphon your vitality and make it hard to keep your fires burning.</p><p>The restorative lies in determinedly tapping into those places where your life force wells up to the surface even during dry spells and downturns, so you can not just survive but also thrive&#x2014;and crucially, take your power back during those times when you feel disempowered, starting with a clear sense of what <i>choice</i> in any given moment will lead you toward or away from your sense of aliveness.</p><p>Each chapter in <i>Vital Signs</i> is a core sample, an intimate biography of one of the strategies you can employ to gain or regain passion&#x2014;including the search for wonder and awe, the quest for novelty, the urge toward self-expression, the hunger to reconnect with inner and outer wildness, the desire to keep passion alive in your relationships, and the role that risk-taking plays in the ripening of passion.</p><p>In exploring what&#x2019;s healthy and essential about these strategies, as well as what&#x2019;s potentially unhealthy and maladaptive about them, this book offers a kind of mug shot of passion&#x2014;so we&#x2019;ll know it when we see it&#x2014;and an expansive menu of possibilities for how to discover and rediscover it.</p><p>The book also affirms the importance of courageous inquiry into our <i>dispassion</i>&#x2014;when we&#x2019;re numb, depressed, stuck, or bored&#x2014;so we&#x2019;ll recognize <i>that</i> when we see it too. Because behind these debilitating conditions is our rightful inheritance of vitality and our incredible capacities.</p><p><i>Vital Signs</i> is also a kind of natural history of passion as it expresses itself in the human experience, following its tracks back to the dens of family, culture, religion, gender, genetics, and primal reflex. It looks at what psychology and science, as well as spirituality and myth, art and literature, history and philosophy, have to say about passion. And of course it shares the personal stories of people who&#x2019;ve claimed and reclaimed their passion and aliveness, propelled by the understanding that being alive without <i>feeling</i> alive is like eating food with no taste to it and that we should insist on living in a world&#x2014;on <i>creating</i> a world&#x2014;that enlivens us rather than deadens us.</p></p><h2>Pack of Cards and Other Stories</h2><p>Thirty-four stories deal with a widow visiting Russia, a tour guide in Egypt, and the stresses of modern life</p><p>In the course of "At the Pitt-Rivers," one of 34 stories in this outstanding collection by the Booker Prize-winning author, a character reflects that just looking at a chance-met girl made you feel "a bit like you were joining in how she felt." That sensation of involvement pervades these stories too--achieved by perfect tone, unerring point of view and unflagging tension. Although the stories are epiphanic the lives of the protagonists can be readily imagined: these people exist. In so mundane a situation as that of "Bus Stop," the conductor--set apart by an educated accent and a dignified bearing--collects a fare from a fashionable woman who turns out to be his sister-in-law, and so dismays her that she rides past her stop. Very little happens in "Nothing Missing but the Samovar," about a young German at Cambridge who spends a few months doing research at a Dorset farm--except that he leaves the farm totally changed. The precise image, the unexpected detail, compassion without sentimentality, are only a few of the elements that make these stories a celebration of the narrative art. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lively follows her Booker Prize-winning Moon Tiger ( LJ 3/15/88) with a lustrous collection of short fiction. These witty, profoundly civilized stories display Lively's compassion, intelligence, and versatility. Echoes of Chekhov distinguish "The Crimean Hotel," a small gem of a story about loneliness set in Yalta. In "A Long Night at Abu Simbel," a guide escorting a group of shrill British tourists through Egypt is so provoked that she abandons them to their fate. In the title story a wealthy, pretentious family is revealed to be as shallow and uninteresting as a pack of cards.

In some countries the use of arms spread even to merchants, townspeople and the peasantry. From the mundane to the fantastic, from simple geometric patterns to elaborate mythological beasts, this fascinating work by Terence Wise explores the origins and appearance of medieval heraldic devices in an engagingly readable style accompanied by numerous illustrations including eight full page colour plates by Richard Hook.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.It is not the aim of this book to describe in precise detail the rules of heraldry, but rather to introduce the reader to the role of heraldry and to provide examples of how it was used in the 14th and 15th centuries.</p><h2>The Total Money Makeover Journal</h2><p><p><strong>When Dave Ramsey was experiencing his own Total Money makeover, he found that journaling was very helpful and effective. </strong></p><p>Dave says, "Take this journal and record everything happening that seems like a big deal.

This book is extremely well researched and also beautifully written. It will satisfy everyone from the hard-core historian to the layman looking for a tragic, true story. The genesis for Hood&#39;s 1864 Tennessee Campaign, the lost opportunity at Spring Hill and the bloody assault at Franklin are all covered. Maps and pictures illuminate the strategies and the action for the reader. The presentation is very balanced from the perspectives of both Federals and Confederates. I have a personal library comprised of numerous books on many Civil War campaigns and battles, and this book ranks among the very best.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Kievan Russia (The History of Russia Series)</h2><p><i>Kievan Russia </i>was originally published in a clothbound edition in 1948 as volume two in George Vernadsky&#x2019;s comprehensive series, <i>A History of Russia.</i> It is now available for the first time in a paperbound edition.

Prior to 1869, anyone who didn't have to live communally in a single building certainly never would. Ensconced in their brownstones around Gramercy Park, the social elite believed in a lack of ostentation, in tempered privacies. But that would change. An architect like Richard Morris Hunt would introduce the ``French flat'' to New York as an alternative to the residential hotel--and for decades thereafter, apartment living became the choice of the bohemian, artistic, nonconforming crowd--safely removed from Society by its eccentricity. (The entire West Side--considered before the turn of the century akin to living in Montana--started off as blithely self-regulating as it essentially has remained.) But then the great mansions of Vanderbilt, Tiffany, and Villard went up in Midtown, and suddenly blue-blood New York had to cope with display and grandeur--and this in time broke down the walls: Polite people perhaps could live in something visually assuming, ornamented, lush, maybe even overlush. The family would not fall apart if domiciled above another, similar family; the subway made the far reaches of uptown livable; and the rebuilding of the city in an image of multiples began. Hawes valuably includes a list of the great apartment houses still standing--but more valuably still creates a context for how a city imagines itself in space (inextricable from the American city's special problem of staying classless while enforcing social hierarchies), employing the novels of Edith Wharton and William Dean Howells, and a wealth of forgotten socioarchitectural journalism so bracing it's a shame the craft has fallen into disuse. A wonderful book. (Sixty-six photographs, drawings, and floor plans) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The so-called Great Era of Luxury Apartment Building, 1869 to 1929, marked New York City's evolution from town to city, from the tradition-bound to modernity. In her first book, Hawes, a former New Yorker staff writer, tells the story in an understated, detail-rich style. She ranges from Richard Morris Hunt, the architect whose Paris sojourn shaped his views of urbanization, to the growth of the utopian-influenced cooperative apartment complexes in the 1880s. She offers histories of famous buildings like the Dakota, named in 1881 for its remoteness on the still rural Upper West Side, and the Waldorf-Astoria, "a microcosm of the urban good life." She explains how the subway stimulated apartment building, how architects adapted classic vocabulary for their projects and how real estate agents hyped these new properties. By the 1920s, an apartment "had become a symbol of the stylish life," Hawes writes; in an appendix, she lists the 86 buildings of the era still standing in Manhattan.

According to Clemens family friend and author Mary Lawton, Leary "seemed so a part of the household &#x2015; so vital and yet so unobtrusively a factor in the life of the family." Clemens himself wrote about Katy, "Fidelity, truthfulness, courage, magnanimity, personal dignity, a pole-star for steadiness &#x2015; these were her equipment, along with a heart of Irish warmth, [and] quick Irish wit..."<br> When Katy was 70 years old &#x2015; after the death of Mark Twain, his wife Olivia, and two of their three daughters, leaving daughter Clara to care for her father's literary estate &#x2015; Ms. Leary sat down with Mary Lawton, a lifelong friend of &nbsp;Clara Clemens, and recounted her experiences with the family.

In this unique memoir, Kite, captain of this year's U.S. Ryder Cup Team, tells the story of Penick, the greatest teacher golf has ever known, his golf secrets, and how he taught them; of Kite's own friendly rivalry with Ben Crenshaw; and of the special relationship enjoyed by all three men. <p>In the same direct way he plays the game, Kite reveals who Harvey Penick really was, his humility and wisdom, and how he became a legend whose <em>Little Red Book</em> remains golf's biggest bestseller and the bible for golfers everywhere.</p><p>With equal candor Kite takes us inside the world of golf: the dramas and pressures of the Ryder Cup, the rigors and mind games of the Tour, and the arrival of the amazing Tiger Woods. Not just another golf book, this is the story of the bonding of generations--the teacher who recently died at the age of ninety and two of the world's best golfers.</p></p><p>Most golfers know the great teacher Harvey Penick, longtime pro at the Austin Country Club in Texas, through the lovely epigrammatic writings of his <i>Little Red Book</i> and the sequels it spawned. Tom Kite, the former U.S. Open champion who captained the 1997 American Ryder Cup team, knew Penick more intimately. He was Kite's instructor, coach, confidante, and touchstone for three decades. His memoir of life with the master is warm and touching, an engaging tribute to a man whose life was the game and whose devotion to the game absolute. Kite also tees up a moving examination of his longtime friendship and rivalry with Ben Crenshaw, Penick's other star pupil. Ultimately, writes Kite, "Penick wasn't meant to be explained or analyzed. He was meant to be enjoyed." In <i>Fairway to Heaven,</i> Kite "takes dead aim"--as Penick always counseled--and the enjoyment is contagious.

This elegant volume showcases the work of a great many Victorian painters, including J.M.W. Turner, John Everett Millais, and James Tissot. Publication to coincide with an exhibition opening at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in February. 225 illustrations, 75 in color.</p><p>Faced with the industrial growth and intellectual challenges of the modern era, painters of Victorian Britain responded with images of contemporary realism and past idealism. The rich velvets, wet leaves, or disastrous storms of the works of Turner, Whistler, and Millais can be seen in all their glory in <i>The Victorians: British Painting 1837-1901,</i> catalogue to the exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Written by Malcolm Warner, curator at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, with contributions by Anne Helmreich and Charles Brock, the catalogue offers examples of work not often seen by American museum-goers. While the book is not lavishly produced, neither thin paper nor inconsistent reproduction quality can repress the richness of the paintings themselves. These luscious colors and languid figures can soften the hardest heart.The Victorian period has, perhaps, been the most stereotyped of all eras. Seen as upright and prudish, kitschy and sentimental, images of the era are discussed with this bias rather than examined as works of art. The current show at the National Gallery of Art, the "first survey exhibition of Victorian painting ever held in the United States," seeks a new context. Reflecting an era of rapid change and industrialization, in which society was coming to grips with a new materialism and the search for some inner faith, these works by artists from Turner to Tissot are a splendid combination of the real and the ideal. Selected for their high artistic quality in both technique and execution, they should do much to inform and engage an American public not fully aware of the period's achievements. Compiled by Warner, curator of paintings at the Yale Center for British Art, this catalog's extensive bibliography, short biographies, and well-annotated catalog entries provide much useful information.

From her childhood in bohemian New York of the 1920s and 30s to her career as a successful - but often financially insecure - painter, designer and chorus performer on Broadway and television. Beckett tells, in honest prose, the story of the many ups and downs she faced living a life in the arts.In To Dance on Sands, Becket reveals the obstacles she had to overcome on her way to becoming a dancer and artist - a distant, judgmental father she almost never saw.a mother who both encouraged and tried to smother her ambitions.the grueling regimen of rehearsals and auditions. the lack of money and the heartbreak of unrequited love. It&#39;s a tale of victories (starring roles as a ballerina), defeats ($10-a-night engagements in the dying days of variety), and her eventual artistic rebirth as the owner, choreographer, and star performer for almost 40 years at the Amargosa Opera House in Death Valley.</p><p>Artist, dancer and model Marta Becket was born in 1924.

As in other central African cultures, the same mask can be used in either magical and religious or festive ceremonies. In order to understand Kifwebe masks, it is essential to consider them within the cosmogony of the python rainbow, metalworking in the forge, and other plant and animal signs.<br><br>Among the Songye, benevolent female masks reveal what is hidden and balance white and red energy associated with two subsequent initiations, the bukishi. Aggressive male masks were originally involved in social control and had a kind of policing role, carried out in accordance with the instructions of village elders. These two male and female forces acted in a balanced way to reinforce harmony within the village. Among the Luba, the masked figures are also benevolent and appear at the new moon, their role being to enhance fertility.<br><br>Although the male and female masks fulfil functions that do not wholly overlap, they do have features in common: a frontal crest, round and excessively protruding eyes, flaring nostrils, a cube-shaped mouth and lips, stripes, and colors.<br><br>Art historians and anthropologists have taken increasing interest in Kifwebe masks in recent years.</p><p>Fran�ois Neyt is professor emeritus at the Catholic University of Louvain and has also taught at the Official University of the Congo.

For the past thirty years Davy has worked with stone in unaltered states, either from the sea or the earth, incorporating them into assemblages of precarious balance that appear to be in flux. He might be thought of as among the first &#x201c;green&#x201d; Postmodern artists. In fact, he comes from a long tradition of post-1960s artists, who either directly or just by their practical sensibility engage Eastern or Zen notions of oneness with nature, organic systems of change as engines of art composition, and non-disruptive respect for natural material in unaltered states. These works manage this, as they illuminate the poetry of nature. As Holly Meyers observed in the Los Angeles Times, there is &#x201c;something thrilling about a work that appears to defy its own natural properties,&#x201d; while at the same time one can appreciate the work's &#x201c;meditative reverence.&#x201d;<br> A recent Cantamar sculpture was acquired in 2018 by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, adding to the 1986 steel and stone sculpture in their permanent collection.

The white skull and crossbones seemed to be straining to keep from being blown off the flapping black flag as the flatbed truck, apparently trying to beat the light, cannonballed through the intersection. The truck heeled over as it cut an arc around the corner. White PVC pipe rolled across the diamond plate of the truck bed, sounding like the sharp rattle of bones. At the speed it was traveling the truck looked to be in danger of capsizing.<br><br>Alex glanced to the only other person waiting at the curb with him. With his mind adrift in distracted thoughts he hadn&#x2019;t before noticed the lone woman standing just in front of him and to the right. He didn&#x2019;t even remember seeing where she&#x2019;d come from. He thought that he saw just a hint of vapor rising from the sides of her arms into the chill air.<br><br>Since he wasn&#x2019;t able to see the woman&#x2019;s face, Alex didn&#x2019;t know if she saw the truck bearing down on them, but he found it difficult to believe that she wouldn&#x2019;t at least hear the diesel engine roaring at full throttle.<br><br>Seeing by the truck&#x2019;s trajectory that it wasn&#x2019;t going to make the corner, Alex snatched the woman&#x2019;s upper arm and yanked her back with him.<br><br>Tires screeched as the great white truck bounced up over the curb right where Alex and the woman had been standing. The front bumper swept past, missing them by inches. Rusty dust billowed out behind the truck. Chunks of sod and dirt flew by.<br><br>Had Alex hesitated they both would have been dead.<br><br>On the white door just above the name &#x201c;Jolly Roger Plumbing&#x201d; was a picture of a jovial pirate with a jaunty black patch over one eye and a sparkle painted in the corner of his smile. Alex glared back as the pirate sailed past.<br><br>When he looked up to see what kind of maniac was driving he instead met the direct, dark glare of a burly passenger. The man&#x2019;s curly beard and thick mat of dark hair made him look like he really could have been a pirate. His eyes, peering out of narrow slits above plump, pockmarked cheeks, were filled with a kind of vulgar rage.<br><br>The big man appeared infuriated that Alex and the woman would dare to be in the way of their off-road excursion. As the door popped open there was no doubt as to his combative intent.<br><br>He looked like a man stepping out of a nightmare.<br><br>Alex felt a cold wave of adrenaline flood through him as he mentally choreographed his moves. The passenger, who seemed to be getting ready to leap out of the still-moving truck, would reach him before the driver could join in, making it one against one&#x2013;at least for a brief time. Alex couldn&#x2019;t believe that it was happening, but it was and he knew that he was going to have to deal with it.<br><br>Calm fury filled him as he prepared himself for the unavoidable. Everything slowed until each beat of his heart seemed to take an eternity. He watched the muscles in the man&#x2019;s arm bulge as he held the door open. In response, Alex&#x2019;s own muscles tightened, ready to meet the threat. His mind was cocooned in silence.<br><br>Just as the passenger&#x2019;s stout leg swung out the open door, flashing lights and the sudden wail of a siren made the burly man turn his attention away. A police car, tires squealing, launched across the intersection in a way that suggested the cops were angered by the truck&#x2019;s stunt. The police car had been parked beside a hedge to the side of the drive into the parking lot across the street. As they had sped past, the men in the truck apparently hadn&#x2019;t seen the parked police car watching traffic. Lost in his own thoughts, Alex hadn&#x2019;t, either.<br><br>The loudspeaker crackled to life. &#x201c;Pull it over!&#x201d;<br><br>The world seemed to rush back in.<br><br>The white plumbing truck, trailing a fog of dust, slowed as it rolled off the curb up ahead, the black-and-white police car right behind it. As the truck stopped, two policemen leaped out, hands resting at the ready on their guns as they approached from both sides of the truck at the same time. They yelled orders and both men carefully emerged with their hands up. In an instant the officers had them out and leaning on the front fenders of the truck.<br><br>Alex felt the tension drain out of his muscles, leaving his knees feeling weak.<br><br>As he turned his glare from the men being frisked, he found the woman&#x2019;s gaze fixed on him. Her eyes were the luscious color of his finest sable artist brushes. It was clearly evident to him that behind those sensuous brown eyes she appraised the world around her with an incisive intellect.<br><br>She glanced deliberately down at his big hand still tightly gripping her upper arm. He had intended to toss her back out of harm&#x2019;s way so that the passenger couldn&#x2019;t hurt her, but the police had shown up first.<br><br>She looked up at him in silent command.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, releasing her arm. &#x201c;You were about to be run down by pirates.&#x201d;<br><br>She said nothing.<br><br>He had meant his comment to be lighthearted, to ease the fright of what had nearly happened, but by her calm expression she didn&#x2019;t appear to be the least bit amused. He hoped he hadn&#x2019;t hurt her arm. He knew that sometimes he didn&#x2019;t realize his own strength.<br><br>Not knowing what to do with his hands, Alex combed his fingers back through his thick hair as he stuffed his other hand in a pocket.<br><br>He cleared his throat, changed his tone to be more serious, and started over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry if I hurt your arm, but that truck would have hit you if I hadn&#x2019;t pulled you back out of the way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It matters to you?&#x201d;<br><br>Her voice was as captivating as her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said, a little puzzled. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t like to see anyone get hurt in an accident like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps it wasn&#x2019;t an accident.&#x201d;<br><br>Her expression was unreadable. He could only wonder at her meaning. He was at a loss as to how to respond.<br><br>The memory of the way she&#x2019;d been standing at the curb still hung in the shadows in the back of his mind. Even lost in distant, dejected thoughts at the time, he had noticed that her body language hadn&#x2019;t been quite right. Because he was an artist, a person&#x2019;s balance, either at rest or in motion, stood out to him. There had been something out of the ordinary about the way she had been standing.<br><br>Alex wasn&#x2019;t sure if, by her answer, she was simply trying to do the same as he had been doing&#x2013;trying to lighten the heart-pounding scare of what had nearly happened&#x2013;or if she was dismissing his chivalry as a presumptuous line. He imagined that a woman as attractive as she was had to deal with men constantly trying clever lines in order to meet her.<br><br>The satiny black dress that hugged her curves looked to be either high fashion or oddly out of time and place&#x2013;he couldn&#x2019;t quite decide which&#x2013;as did the long, deep green wrap draped over her shoulders. Her luxuriant fall of soft, summer-blond hair could have gone either way as well.<br><br>Alex figured that she had to be on her way to the exclusive jewelry store that was the anchor of the upscale Regent Center across the street. The slanted glass fa�ade was just visible beyond the shade of ash and linden trees spread across the broad grounds separating the upscale shops from Regent Boulevard.<br><br>He glanced over at the plumbing truck sitting at the curb. The strobing lights from the police car made the white truck look alternately blue and red.<br><br>After getting handcuffs on the passenger, the police officer pointed at the curb and told the man to sit beside the driver. The man sat and crossed his legs. Both wore dark work clothes covered with grime. While both men quietly did as they were told, neither looked to be the least bit cowed.<br><br>One of the officers started toward Alex as the other spoke into the radio clipped to his shirt at the shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you two all right?&#x201d; the man asked as he approached, his voice still carrying an adrenaline edge. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t hit you, did they?&#x201d;<br><br>Both of the cops were young and built like weightlifters. Both had bull necks. Black, short-sleeved shirts stretched over the swell of their arms served only to emphasize the size of their muscles.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Alex said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Glad to hear it. That was quick thinking.

To the reader as well as the spectator, today as well as three centuries ago, the appeal of his plays is immediate and durable; they are both instantly accessible and inexhaustible. His rich resources make it hard to decide, much less to agree, on the secret of his greatness. After generations had seen him mainly as a moralist, many critics today have shifted the stress to the director and actor whose life was the comic stage; but all ages have rejoiced in three somewhat overlapping qualities of his: comic inventiveness, richness of fabric, and insight.</p><p>His inventiveness is extraordinary. An actor-manager-director-playwright all in one, he knew and loved the stage as few have done, and wrote with it and his playgoing public always in mind. In a medium in which sustained power is one of the rarest virtues, he drew on the widest imaginable range, from the broadest slapstick to the subtlest irony, to carry out the arduous and underrated task of keeping an audience amused for five whole acts. Working usually under great pressure of time, he took his materials where he found them, yet always made them his own.</p><p>The fabric of his plays is rich in many ways: in the intense life he infuses into his characters; in his constant preoccupation with the comic mask, which makes most of his protagonists themselves&#x2014;consciously or unconsciously&#x2014;play a part, and leads to rich comedy when their nature forces them to drop the mask; and in the weight of seriousness and even poignancy that he dares to include in his comic vision. Again and again he leads us from the enjoyable but shallow reaction of laughing at a fool to recognizing in that fool others whom we know, and ultimately ourselves; which is surely the truest and deepest comic catharsis.</p><p>Moli�re&#x2019;s insight makes his characters understandable and gives a memorable inevitability to his comic effects. He is seldom completely realistic, of course; his characters, for example, tend to give themselves away more generously and laughably than is customary in life; but it is their true selves they give away. It is an obvious trick, and not very realistic, to have Orgon in <i>Tartuffe </i>(Act I, scene 4) reply four times to the account of his wife&#x2019;s illness with the question &#x201c;And Tartuffe?&#x201d; and reply, again four times, to each report of Tartuffe&#x2019;s gross health and appetite, &#x201c;Poor fellow!&#x201d; But it shows us, rapidly and comically, that Orgon&#x2019;s obsession has closed his mind and his ears to anything but what he wants to see and hear. In the following scene, it may be unrealistic to have him in one speech (ll. 276&#x2013;79) boast of learning from Tartuffe such detachment from worldly things that he could see his whole family die without concern, and in the very next speech (ll. 306&#x2013;10) praise Tartuffe for the scrupulousness that led him to reproach himself for killing a flea in too much anger. But&#x2014;again apart from the sheer comedy&#x2014;it is a telling commentary on the distortion of values that can come from extreme points of view. One of Moli�re&#x2019;s favorite authors, Montaigne, had written about victims of moral <i>hubris:</i> &#x201c;They want to get out of themselves and escape from the man. That is madness: instead of changing into angels, they change into beasts.&#x201d; Moli�re is presenting the same idea dramatically, as he does with even more power later (Act IV, scene 3, l. 1293), when Orgon&#x2019;s daughter has implored him not to force her to marry the repulsive Tartuffe, and he summons his will to resist her with these words:</p><p>Be firm, my heart! No human weakness now!</p><p>These moments of truth, these flashes of unconscious self-revelation that plunge us into the very center of an obsession, abound in Moli�re, adding to our insight even as they reveal his. And even as he caricatures aspects of himself in the reforming Alceste or in the jealous older lover in Arnolphe, so he imparts to his moments of truth not only the individuality of the particular obsession but also the universality of our common share in it.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Moli�re is one of those widely known public figures whose private life remains veiled. In his own time gossip was rife, but much of it comes from his enemies and is suspect. Our chief other source is his plays; but while these hint at his major concerns and lines of meditation, we must beware of reading them like avowals or his roles like disguised autobiography.*</p><p>He was born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in Paris early in 1622 and baptized on January 15, the first son of a well-to-do bourgeois dealer in tapestry and upholstery. In 1631 his father bought the position of <i>valet de chambre tapissier ordinaire du roi, </i>and six years later obtained the right to pass it on at his own death to his oldest son, who took the appropriate &#x201c;oath of office&#x201d; at the age of fifteen. Together with many sons of the best families, Jean-Baptiste received an excellent education from the Jesuit Fathers of the Coll�ge de Clermont. He probably continued beyond the basic course in rhetoric to two years of philosophy and then law school, presumably at Orl�ans.</p><p>Suddenly, as it appears to us, just as he was reaching twenty-one, he resigned his survival rights to his father&#x2019;s court position, and with them the whole future that lay ahead of him; drew his share in the estate of his dead mother and a part of his own prospective inheritance; and six months later joined in forming, with and around Madeleine B�jart, a dramatic company, the Illustre-Th��tre. In September 1643 they rented a court-tennis court to perform in; in October they played in Rouen; in January 1644 they opened in Paris; in June young Poquelin was named head of the troupe, and signed himself, for the first time we know of, &#x201c;de Moli�re.&#x201d;</p><p>Moli�re&#x2019;s was an extraordinary decision. Apart from the financial hazards, his new profession stood little above pimping or stealing in the public eye and automatically involved minor excommunication from the Church. To write for the theater, especially tragedy, carried no great onus; to be an actor, especially in comedy and farce, was a proof of immorality. Though Richelieu&#x2019;s passion for the stage had improved its prestige somewhat, this meant only that a few voices were raised to maintain its possible innocence against the condemnation of the vast majority.</p><p>Obviously young Moli�re was in love with the theater, and had to act. He may also have been already in love with Madeleine B�jart; their contemporaries were probably right in thinking them lovers, though all we actually know is that they were stanch colleagues and business partners. Their loyalty was tested from the first. Although the B�jarts raised all the money they could, after a year and a half in Paris the company failed and had to break up; Moli�re was twice imprisoned in the Ch�telet for debt; he and the B�jarts left Paris to try their luck in the provinces. For twelve years they were on the road, mainly in the south.</p><p>For the first five of these they joined the company, headed by Du Fresne, of the Duc d&#x2019;�pernon in Guyenne. When d&#x2019;�pernon dropped them, Moli�re became head of the troupe. From 1653 to 1657 they were in the service of a great prince of the blood, the Prince de Conti, until his conversion. Even with a noble patron, the life was nomadic and precarious, and engagements hard to get. However, the company gradually made a name for itself and prospered. Moli�re gained a rich firsthand knowledge of life on many levels. In the last few years of their wanderings he tried his hand as a playwright with such plays as <i>L&#x2019;�tourdi </i>and <i>Le D�pit amoureux.</i></p><p>At last in 1658 they obtained another chance to play in the capital. On October 24 they appeared before young Louis XIV, his brother, and the court, in the guard room of the old Louvre, in a performance of Corneille&#x2019;s tragedy <i>Nicom�de, </i>which Moli�re followed with his own comedy <i>The Doctor in Love. </i>Soon they became the Troupe de Monsieur (the King&#x2019;s brother) and were installed by royal order in the Th��tre du Petit-Bourbon. Though they still performed tragedies, they succeeded more and more in comedy, in which Moli�re was on his way to recognition as the greatest actor of his time.</p><p>Within a year he made his mark also as a playwright with <i>The Ridiculous Pr�cieuses </i>(November 18, 1659), which, though little more than a sketch, bore the stamp of his originality, keen observation, and rich comic inventiveness.* Nearly thirty-eight, Moli�re was to have thirteen more years to live, and was to live them as though he knew this was all. To his responsibilities as director and actor he added a hectic but glorious career as a very productive playwright, author of thirty-two comedies that we know, of which a good third are among the comic masterpieces of world literature. The stress of his many roles, of deadlines, and of controversy is well depicted in <i>The Versailles Impromptu. </i>Success led to success&#x2014;and often to more controversy&#x2014;but never to respite. He was to be carried off the stage to his deathbed. No doubt he wanted it that way, or almost that way; for probably no man has ever been more possessed by the theater.</p><p>On February 20, 1662, at the age of forty, he married the twenty-year-old Armande B�jart, a daughter (according to the mostly spiteful contemporaries) or sister (according to the official documents) of Madeleine. Though what we know of their domestic life is almost nothing, contemporary gossip, a friend&#x2019;s letter, and Moli�re&#x2019;s own preoccupation in several plays with a jealous older man in love with a flighty young charmer, combine to suggest an uneasy relationship. They had two sons who died in infancy and a daughter who survived. The King himself and his sister-in-law (Madame) were godfather and godmother to the first boy&#x2014;no doubt to defend Moli�re against a charge, or rumor, that he had married his own daughter.</p><p>When the Petit-Bourbon theater was torn down in October 1660 to make way for the new fa�ade of the Louvre, things looked bad; but the King granted the company the use of Richelieu&#x2019;s great theater, the Palais-Royal, which remained Moli�re&#x2019;s until his death. An early success there was his regular, elaborate verse comedy, <i>The School for Husbands. </i>Within a year of his marriage he wrote his first great play and one of his most popular, <i>The School for Wives. </i>It aroused much controversy; when Moli�re published it, he dedicated it to Madame; the King gave him the support he sought in the form of a pension of one thousand francs for this &#x201c;excellent comic poet.&#x201d; <i>The Critique of the School for Wives </i>and <i>The Versailles Impromptu </i>(June and October 1663) completed Moli�re&#x2019;s victory in the eyes of the public.</p><p>However, his attack on extreme piety and hypocrisy in <i>Tartuffe </i>showed him the strength of his enemies. The first three-act version, performed in May 1664, was promptly banned. For the next five years much of his time and energy went into the fight to get it played: petitions, private readings, revisions, private performances. In August 1667 a five-act version entitled <i>The Impostor </i>was allowed a second public performance&#x2014;then also banned. Only in February 1669 was the version that we know put on, with enormous success; and this time it was on the program to stay.</p><p>Meanwhile Moli�re had hit back at his enemies in 1665 in <i>Don Juan, </i>which he soon withdrew. In August of that year his company became The King&#x2019;s Troupe, and his pension was raised to six thousand francs. A year later he completed his greatest and most complex play, <i>The Misanthrope, </i>which met only a modest success, and the light but brilliant farce that often served as a companion piece, <i>The Doctor in Spite of Himself. </i>In 1668 he displayed the bitter comic profundities of <i>The Miser; </i>and in the last four years of his life&#x2014;still to mention only his finest plays&#x2014;<i>The Would-Be Gentleman, The Mischievous Machinations of Scapin, The Learned Women, </i>and <i>The Imaginary Invalid.</i></p><p>Moli�re&#x2019;s last seven years were dogged by pulmonary illness. A bad bout in early 1666 and another in 1667 led him to accept a milk diet and spend much of the next four years apart from his wife in his house in Auteuil. The year before his own death saw those of his old friend Madeleine B�jart and later of his second son. As his health grew worse, he composed&#x2014;characteristically&#x2014;his final gay comedy about a healthy hypochondriac. Before its fourth performance, on February 17, 1673, he felt very ill; his wife and one of his actors urged him not to play that evening; he replied that the whole company depended a lot on him and that it was a point of honor to go on. He got through his part, in spite of one violent fit of coughing. A few hours later he was dead. Since he had not been able, while dying, to get a priest to come and receive his formal renunciation of his profession, a regular religious burial was denied at first, and later grudgingly granted&#x2014;at night, with no notice, ceremony, or service&#x2014;only after his widow&#x2019;s plea to the King. He died and was buried as he had lived&#x2014;as an actor.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Translations of Moli�re abound. Two of the most available, both complete, are by H. Baker and J. Miller (1739) and Henri Van Laun (1875&#x2013;76). The former is satisfactory, but its eighteenth-century flavor is not always Moli�re&#x2019;s; the latter is dull. Better for the modern reader are the versions of selected plays by John Wood (1953 and 1959), George Graveley (1956), and especially three others.</p><p>Curtis Hidden Page has translated eight well-chosen plays (Putnam, 1908, 2 vols.) which include three verse comedies done into unrhymed verse. Though it sometimes lacks sparkle, his version is always intelligent and responsible.</p><p>Morris Bishop&#x2019;s recent translation of nine plays (one for Crofts Classics, 1950, eight for Modern Library, 1957) is much the best we have for all but two. His excellent selection includes six in prose <i>(Pr�cieuses, Critique, Impromptu, Physician in Spite of Himself, Would-Be Gentleman, Would-Be Invalid) </i>and three done into unrhymed verse <i>(School for Wives, Tartuffe, Misanthrope). </i>His knowledge of Moli�re and talent for comic verse make his translation lively and racy, and his occasional liberties are usually well taken.</p><p>Richard Wilbur has translated Moli�re&#x2019;s two greatest verse plays, <i>The Misanthrope </i>and <i>Tartuffe, </i>into rhymed verse (Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World, Inc., 1955 and 1963). They are the best Moli�re we have in English. My sense of their excellence is perhaps best stated personally. I have long wanted to try my hand at translating Moli�re. When the Wilbur <i>Misanthrope </i>appeared, I decided not to attempt it unless I thought I would do that play either better or at least quite differently. When I finally tried it, I was surprised to find how different I wanted to make it. Wilbur&#x2019;s end product is superb; but in his <i>Misanthrope </i>I sometimes miss the accents of Moli�re.* His <i>Tartuffe </i>seems to me clearly better, since it follows the original closely even in detail.

In 1982, convinced that there is no essential difference between &#x2018;early&#x2019; and &#x2018;late&#x2019; Stravinsky, Louis Andriessen and Elmer Sch�nberger were the first to write a monograph on the composer which radically breaks with the habit of dividing his works into &#x2018;Russian&#x2019;, &#x2018;neoclassical&#x2019; and &#x2018;serial&#x2019;. In an essay which continually shifts in its approach, style and perspective, the authors elaborate on their insight that a single, immutable compositional attitude underlies the whole of Stravinsky&#x2019;s oeuvre. By this token the book not only offers an analysis of the composer&#x2019;s protean work and artistry but takes example by it as well.</p><p>Elmer Sch�nberger (1950) is a musicologist, composer and writer. From 1976 to 2004 he was head music critic for the Dutch weekly Vrij Nederland. His most recent book was about musical essays named Het Gebroken Oor (2005), his most recent composition Dressing Old Words new (2005) and his most recent theater play Naar Moskou, Moskou (2005). Louis Andriessen (1939) is widely regarded as a central figure in the international new music scene. Performers of his work include the two Dutch groups named after his works De Volharding and Hoketus, the Asko/Schoenberg Ensemble, London Sinfonietta, Ensemble Modern and Bang On A Can All Stars. Amongst his many works for music theater are collaborations with Peter Greenaway (Rosa, Writing to Vermeer) and Hal Hartley.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch</p><h2>Delivering Views: Distant Cultures in Early Postcards</h2><p>The heyday of postcard production was also an era of rapidly expanding European and American control over the rest of the world. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, images of distant peoples from the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Asia became ubiquitous souvenirs of imperialism.<br><br>The six contributors to this abundantly illustrated volume show how images of Plains Indians, World's Fair cards, and portraits from Africa, the Pacific Islands, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan documented distant cultures but also reinforced Western biases by emphasizing the seemingly vast cultural differences between viewers and subjects. The authors discuss the differences between original photographs and their postcard equivalents, and they explore in detail common practices -- such as artificial settings, costumes and props, colorization, and patronizing captions -- that perpetuated racist, sexist, and romantic stereotypes.<br><br>Drawing on anthropological, historical, and art historical analyses, contributors examine examples from both public and private collections, tracing the postcard's overlapping roles as souvenir, collectible, and popular art form. Showcasing 132 images, many of which have never before been published, the book concludes that early postcards both provide historical information about the peoples they depict and reveal Westerners' perceptions of -- and apprehensions about -- cultures that differed from their own.</p><p><b>Christraud M. Geary</b> is the curator of the Eliot Elisofon Photographic Archives at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art.<br><br><b>Virginia-Lee Webb</b> is the archivist of the photograph collection in the department of the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.As European influence and control penetrated vast areas of Asia and Africa in the nineteenth century, the sending of postcards was frequently a means for European settlers, civil servants, and military officials to convey images of their new surroundings to family and friends back home. This wonderful collection of 132 cards provides a window on the way a dominant, dynamic culture perceived traditional, static, indigenous cultures. In general, the cards do not depict individuals as much as &#34;exotic&#34; archetypes. Many of the shots are clearly posed to convey an image of primitive and savage but still &#34;noble&#34; majesty. The striking photographs are accompanied by a text that is easily digested and highly informative, particularly in its recounting of the evolution of the postcard industry.

A first-rate work of scholarly synthesis."&#x2015;Robert McNeal</strong></p>In St. Petersburg on October 25, 1917, the A commanding chronicle of the three Bolshevik Party stormed the capital city and turbulent years that brought the ironfisted seized the power over the Russian Provisional Soviet regime to political power. Government, which had been operating ineffectively since the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II eight months before. That October Revolution began the Russian Civil War, which in three years would cost the largest country in the world more than seven million lives.It was an apocalyptic struggle, replete with famine and pestilence, but out of the struggle a new social order would rise: The Soviet Union. Mawdsley offers a lucid, superbly detailed account of the men and events that shaped twentieth century communist Russia. He draws upon a wide range of sources to recount the military course of the war, as well as the hardship the conflict brought to a country and its people&#x2015;for the victory and the reconstruction of the state under the Soviet regime came at a painfully high economic and human price.</p><p>Evan Mawdsley has written numerous books on Russian history, including The Soviet Elite from Lenin to Gorbachev; Thunder in the East: The Nazi-Soviet War 1941-1945 and The Stalin Years. He is Professor of Modern History at Glasgow University.The Russian Civil War is an event which generally gets lumped together with the the Great War. In fact, seven million people died because of it. That rather puts the American Civil War in the shade, though there are endless television dramas made on that conflict. Mawdsley takes us deftly through the myriad political allegiances and betrayals which led to such loss of life. Overwhelmingly we see the cancer of zealotry and dogmatism sweeping aside all humanity - a precursor of the horror to come under Stalin.<br><br>Just how inevitable was the Red victory in the ferocious civil conflict that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917? Mawdsley, an admirably levelheaded British historian, shows that despite the fractured nature and inherent weakness of the White forces, the odds were heavily stacked against the Reds. They faced foreign military intervention and a vast battleground that favored their foes.... Mawdsley skillfully boils down complex situations without oversimplifying them, and his vivid, readable account of this savage war is now the most authoritative in English.<br><br>Hands up: Who knew that American forces once invaded Russia? The Russian Civil War, writes Mawdsley (Modern History/Glasgow Univ.; Thunder in the East: The Nazi-Soviet War, 1941 - 1945, 2006, etc.), began just as soon as moved swiftly to consolidate power, repressing the socialists who dominated the nation as a whole but who were weak in the industrial cities. At the same time, Cossacks, monarchists, cadets and other foes of the new regime took up arms, while "the civilian opponents of the Bolsheviks, people of the moderate Left and Right, lacked effective combat forces of their own and played no parts." The contending extremist armies, Red and White, would be locked in war for the next three years, with units from the British, American and French armies appearing on various fronts to battle the Bolshevik forces. The state established a program of what the regime called "War Communism," taking emergency measures that in some cases turned out to be permanent. Radical policies of appropriation and state monopoly, backed by a powerful army, "helped the Bolsheviks to take power," writes Mawdsley, even if "as the months passed . . . the political benefits came to look more dubious" as productivity plummeted and food shortages gripped the nation - driving many farmers, in the bargain, into the anticommunist camp. The Whites soon began to lose the fight, however, routed at places such as Tsaritsyn, a city on the Volga that would be renamed Stalingrad. Mawdsley attributes the loss to many factors, from being outnumbered and outgunned to the staggering incompetence of many White generals and the lack of central coordination among the anti-Bolshevik forces. Sporadic fighting continued until 1922in Siberia, carried out by figures such as the Baron Ungern-Sternberg, "an unbalanced Baltic nobleman . . . already notorious for his atrocities in Transbaikal." After that time, though, Soviet domination was complete and would endure for another seven decades. A well-rendered account of a history too little known in the West.</p><h2>Genesis: A Biography</h2><p>The music group Genesis have been making records for 25 years.

Each chapter presents one story that exemplifies a quality or way of life that will encourage in readers a sense of inner peace amidst the busyness of modern life. From the hunting adventures of the raven and the wolf, we see the importance of tolerance; the lessons of the grasshopper impart the wisdom of patience; and the experiences of a young man named Walks Alone teach us about silence and turning within. Speaking to these and other universal qualities, such as faith and selflessness, Marshall gives readers insight into their own lives using tales from the past interspersed with stories from his own life growing up on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota. In him, we see a clear example of the wisdom of history enhancing the state of the current world. This magnificent work will give readers an insider&#x2019;s view of the Lakota people while providing universal lessons to enrich life.<br></p><p>Joseph Marshall III was born and raised on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation and is an enrolled member of the Sicangu Lakota (Rosebud Sioux) tribe. Because he was raised in a traditional Lakota household by his maternal grandparents, his first language is Lakota. In that environment he also learned the ancient tradition of oral storytelling. Marshall is an author with nine nonfiction works, three novels, a collection of short stories and essays, and several screenplays to his credit. He is also a speaker and lecturer, having appeared throughout the United States and in countries such as France, Sweden, and Siberia. Marshall has also appeared in television documentaries, served as technical advisor for movies, and served as the narrator for the six-part mini-series <i>Into the West</i>, as well as playing the on-screen role of &#x201c;Loved by the Buffalo,&#x201d; a Lakota medicine man. Website: http://www.josephmarshall.com&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This book is certain to become a classic in Native American literature as well as a guide for anyone who seeks larger spiritual truths. Marshall, a Sicangu elder, is well on his way to becoming an elder for all of America.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Roger Welsch</b>, author of <i>Embracing Fry Bread: Confessions of a Wannabe</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;In this fine collection of stories, Marshall eloquently delivers some hard truths in a soft package.

He&#x2019;s also a very wise man. In these evocative vignettes from Lakota legend and rich personal experience, he reminds his readers that even in the overstimulated, overstressed 21st century, the greatest peace is to be found in simple, universal values and quiet contemplation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Kirk Ellis</b>, writer/producer of TNT&#x2019;s <i>Into the West </i>and HBO&#x2019;s <i>John Adams</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Through the beautiful teachings of his Lakota elders Joseph Marshall shares with the reader many of life&#x2019;s truths. He reminds us of the simplicity and the sanctity of life. There are no new magical answers or solutions to life&#x2019;s mysteries in this collection, but there are certainly powerful lessons that one can choose to embrace.

Editor Terry Cook&#39;s introductory essay places the significance of Samuels&#39; ideas in the context of modern archival practice and traces her influence on North American archival thinking. Divided in two sections, the first nine essays explore the rich contexts in which the appraisal of potential archival sources takes place and focus on understanding and managing all documentation to select the small percentage that will survive in archives. Several chapters trace how the profession is being radically transformed in the digital age with topics such as making a case for electronic records management, documenting appraisal as a societal-archival process, and challenging stereotypes about corporate archives. The second section looks at both the documentation and who is doing the documenting. Seven essays explore the nature, influences, and ethics of archivists and their roles in appraising records, documenting society and its institutions, and describing records with digital tools. A pair of retrospective reflections round out the volume, including one from Samuels, who reflects on the origins of her work on appraisal. Just as archivists shape what society can know about itself through documentation, so, too, this book is bound to shape contemporary archival perspectives about the challenges and responsibilities of &#34;controlling the past.&#34; Read it and see.</p><p></p><h2>The T-Shirt Book</h2><p>This 400-page book features hundreds of colorful examples of the T-shirt at its legendary best, from its humble origins as an undergarment to its current star status as a classic piece of clothing worn by billions around the world.

Nine months later, the now classic <i>Story of a Soul</i> appeared and proved an immediate success. However, when historians had access fifty years later to manuscripts written by Th�r�se they were surprised to discover enormous differences between these texts and the published version of <i>Story of a Soul</i>. Jean-Fran�ois Six has written this new book with two purposes. First, he recalls the history of how Mother Agn�s, Prioress of the Carmelite convent and sister of Th�r�se altered and completed Th�r�se's text so that it became a travesty of the original. Secondly he re-establishes the truth of the last months of Th�r�se's life, her authentic spiritual message, and her contribution to the history of mysticism. In working on his book, Jean-Fran�ois Six has relied on texts which can definitively be said to come from the hand of Th�r�se. In contrast to the sentimentality which is so often associated with her, he has found a powerful, lively figure, full of humor even in the depths of the spiritual night she experienced during her last months-the spiritual night which others have tried to deny or minimize.</p><p>Jean-Fran�ois Six is currently Director of the Centre National de Meditation in Paris.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Railway Children (Classics)</h2><p>When their father is mysteriously taken away, Bobbie, Peter and Phyllis must move with their mother to a little house in the country.

Kovacs is associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia and series editor of the Blackwell Bible Commentaries, which focus on the reception history of the biblical books.Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, one of the earliest Christian writings, had enormous influence on the formation of Christian teaching. In this Church's Bible volume Judith L. Kovacs weaves comments from all the commentaries and sermon series written in Latin or Greek between the years 250 and 800, illustrating the historic Christian understanding of this crucial text.<p>The church fathers gathered here include Augustine of Hippo, Irenaeus, Gregory of Nyssa, Athanasius, Origen, John Chrysostom, and many more. Preceding the line-by-line exegesis are a lucid essay by Robert Louis Wilken on how the church fathers interpreted the New Testament, an informative introduction to 1 Corinthians by Kovacs, and two chapters of general patristic commentary on Paul and on this letter. Completing the volume are several helpful appendixes and indexes. </p><p>Freshly translating many passages into idiomatic English for the first time, Kovacs does not merely excerpt random quotes from the church fathers but instead produces a sustained interaction with their direct comments on 1 Corinthians. This soaking in the wisdom of the past is sure to spiritually refresh and intellectually sharpen contemporary readers who seek to better understand this part of Scripture.</p></p><h2>Three From Galilee: The Young Man from Nazareth</h2><p>The sequel to the best-selling novel Two from Galilee portrays the life of Jesus from the age of twelve, when he debated the elders in the Temple, through age thirty, when he began his ministry, a period not covered in the Bible. Reprint.</p><p>From Marjorie Holmes, one of the most beloved authors of our times, comes the stunning story you have been asking for, the inspiring sequel to her national bestseller, <i>Two From Galilee</i>...<i>Three From Galilee</i>.<p></p><p>Rooted in her broad knowledge of the Bible and of history, Marjorie's wonderful new novel explores the "lost years" of Jesus' young manhood-a period not even mentioned in the Bible. Where did he go and what did he do between the age of twelve, when we last see him debating the elders in the temple, and the age of thirty, when he began his ministry? What were those years like for Mary? Was her son as human as his brothers? Was it possible that he, too, could fall in love?

This book has been held in the highest honour in Ethiopia for several centuries and has been, and still is, venerated by the people as containing the final proof of their descent from the Hebrew Patriarchs, and of the kinship of their kings of the Solomonic line with Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <p>In other words, the book proves: </p><p>1. That the lawful kings of Ethiopia were descended from Solomon, King of Israel. </p><p>2. That the Tabernacle of the Law of God, the Ark of the Covenant was brought from Jerusalem to Aksum by Menyelek, Solomon's firstborn son. </p><p>3. That the God of Israel transferred His place of abode on earth from Jerusalem to Aksum, the ecclesiastical capital of Ethiopia. </p><p>Menyelek was performing the Will of God in removing the Tabernacle of Zion from Jerusalem, as God was satisfied that the Jews were unworthy to be custodians of the Ark wherein His Presence was, and the Ark wished to depart. Ethiopia had stretched out her hands to God (Psalm 68:31) and He went to her with the Ark, to preside over Menyelek's kingdom, which was established in accordance with the commandments that He had given Moses and the prophets and priests of Israel. </p><p>The line of kings founded by Solomon continued to reign even after the Ethiopians became Christians under the teaching of Frumentius and Adesius, and that line continued unbroken until the tenth century of our era. God then permitted the line to be separated from the throne, and allowed the Zagwe Kings to rule over Ethiopia until the reign of Yekuno Amlak, who restored the Solomonic dynasty in A.D. 1270. </p><p>Ethiopian literature documents a legend to the effect that when god made Adam He placed in his body a "Pearl" or "Seed" which He intended should pass from Adam into the bodies of a series of holy men, one after the other, until the appointed time when it should enter the body of Mary, and form the substance of her firstborn son Jesus, the Christ. This "Pearl" had passed through the body of Solomon, an ancestor of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and Menyelek, the son of Solomon by the Queen of Sheba, were sons of Solomon, and so, they were akin to each other. But Christ is the Son of God, and therefore, being the kinsman of Christ, Menyelek was divine. </p><p>The Kebra Nagast asserts that the kings of Ethiopia who were descended from Menyelek were of divine origin, and that their words and deeds were those of gods. </p><p>The Ark of the Law which Menyelek removed from the Temple of Jerusalem was a rectangular box made of hardwood plated with gold, and measuring about four feet long, two feet six inches wide, and two feet six inches deep. It was provided with a cover upon which rested the Mercy seat and figures of the Cherubim. In the Kebra Nagast no mention is made of the Mercy sear and the Cherubim, but we read there that Moses made a case shaped like the "belly of a ship," and in this the Two Tables of the Law were placed. The case made by Moses carried the written Word in stone, and later on the Women carried the living Word Incarnate. Although western history is silent as to the place where the Tabernacle of the Law was finally deposited, Ethiopian tradition asserts that it survived all the troubles and disasters that came upon the Abyssinians in their wars with the Muslims, and that it was preserved at Aksum. </p><p>This complete, modern translation of the Kebra Nagast derives mainly from the Spanish version of the work which appeared in Toledo in 1528 and in Barcelona in 1547, with its French version published in Paris in 1558.</p></p><p>Lost for centuries, the Kebra Nagast (The Glory of Kings) is a truly majestic unveiling of ancient secrets. These pages were excised by royal decree from the authorized 1611 King James version of the Bible. Originally recorded in the ancient Ethiopian language (Ge'ez) by anonymous scribes, The Red Sea Press, Inc. and Kingston Publishers now bring you a complete, accurate modern English translation of this long suppressed account. Here is the most startling and fascinating revelation of hidden truths; not only revealing the present location of the Ark of the Covenant, but also explaining fully many of the puzzling questions on Biblical topics which remained unanswered up to today. <p>"...(O)nly in the Kebra Nagast, and not in the Bible...the bold assertion is made...that the Ark had gone from Jerusalem to Ethiopia." "...(H)ow could the most important Biblical object in the world end up in the heart of Africa...? The Kebra Nagast...with a great deal of weight and historical authenticity...offers a clear answer to this question...as Ethiopia's claim to be the last resting place of the lost Ark remains unchallenged..." "...(T)he Kebra Nagast's audacious claim of a massive cover-up...(and) all information about the tragic loss of the Ark during Solomon's reign had been suppressed, which is why no mention is made of it in the Scriptures." "...a great epic...a remarkable document ...erected above a solid foundation of historical truth."</p>Dr. Miguel F. Brooks is a teacher, author-publisher, biblical scholar and researcher.

It&#39;s just through the backyard. But this backyard isn&#39;t just any backyard when viewed with the imagination. It can be a forest inhabited by a dragon and a sleeping giant. It can be rocks near a shore, with a boat just ready to take you out to sea, where there might be whales, mermaids, or even pirates! Each color scene is viewed from above and filled with details.</p><p>Ages 5-8. Going to the store on a simple errand becomes an adventure, for narrator and viewer both, in this visual imagination stretcher from the author of <i>Looking For Cinderella</i> (1996). Each scene offers a bird's-eye view of streets, houses, and yards that seem ordinary at first glance but where a leafy patch conceals a dragon or a giant, a child clad in red meets a certain wolf, and a pond becomes an ocean, with shipwrecks, mermaids, and a majestic whale visible below the glassy surface. Further marvels await discovery by the sharp of eye--the graffiti that mysteriously appears on a newly painted house, the bearded dwarves trooping into a certain thatched cottage. Children who enjoy following pathways in pictures and carefully examining odd corners for small details--in other words, fans of Arthur Geisert's etchings and Joan Steiner's assemblages--will pore over these uncluttered views. The minimal text ends with a suggestion: "How do we get back? Maybe we should take the sidewalk?" No way! <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Stealthily passing the pirates' den, he arrives safely at the store, buys his apples, and returns home via the sidewalk. Illustrations are colorful spreads that are viewed from above. As the child enters the forest and climbs over rocks to the sea, the view becomes a close-up. Visual perspective is awkwardly off balance as readers follow the adventurer through his journey.

Inspiration for Nagle&#39;s work often comes from unusual sources, but his work is also grounded in tradition. He frequently cites the influence of shibui, an aesthetic of contrast and balance that is highly prized in Japan. When Nagle makes a sculpture, the proportion of each color is essential; the most vibrant hue might be confined to a thin stripe along its base. &#34;That&#39;s the zinger,&#34; he says. &#34;In music they&#39;d call it a hook. Your eye will go there in reference to the other colors.&#34; Each sculpture is reproduced in full color, at or near actual size. In the interview, Nagle speaks with fellow San Francisco sculptor Vincent Fecteau about scale, color, and music, as well as Nagle&#39;s early friendships with other West Coast artists - Peter Voulkos, Ken Price, and Jim Melchert - making innovative work in clay.</p><p></p><h2>Hawaii&#39;s Strangest, Ickiest, Wildest Book Ever</h2><p>Science, natural history, animals, Hawaiian history, island trivia ...

During his numerous forced incarcerations he vowed to write some day about his experiences and the injustices of involuntary commitment. In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of "normal." The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed. Like any great storyteller, Coelho has used the realm of fiction to magically infiltrate and alter the realm of reality. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything&#x2014;youth and beauty, boyfriends and a loving family, a fulfilling job.

W. Griffith: a bigger-than-life American folk hero whose important life story is nearly forgotten today. Now, in a feat of historical investigation and vivid storytelling, one of our greatest film biographers takes on one of the most talented and complex figures in the history of American entertainment.</p><p>The son of freed slaves, Micheaux grew up in Metropolis, Illinois, then roamed America as a Pullman porter before making his first mark as a homesteader in South Dakota. Disaster and defeat there led him to forge a career publishing a successful series of autobiographical novels. Ever the entrepreneur, when Hollywood failed to bid high enough for film rights to his stories, he answered by forming his own film production company. Going on to produce or direct twenty-two silent and fifteen sound films in his lifetime, Micheaux became the king of the "race cinema" industry at a time when black-produced films had to scrounge for venues in a segregated society. </p><p>In this groundbreaking new biography, award-winning film historian Patrick McGilligan offers a vivid and fascinating portrait of this little-known pioneer. Part visionary, part raffish Barnum-like showman, Micheaux was both a maverick filmmaker and an inveterate hustler who used every weapon at his disposal to break the color barrier and thrive in a profession he helped to invent. He made a fortune and lost it again, and launched repeated con games that were followed by public arrests and bankruptcies. He eagerly took credit for the work of others&#x2014;including his unsung-heroine wife. In his desperate later years, he even sunk to plagiarizing his final novel&#x2014;a discovery McGilligan reveals here for the first time. </p><p>In this searching exploration, McGilligan tracks down long-lost financial records, unpublished letters, and unmarked pauper's graves, pinpointing Micheaux's birthplace, his tangled personal life, and the circumstances of his tragic death. The result is an epic that bridges a fascinating period in American history, and offers lessons for anyone who would understand the role of black America in forming the culture of our time.</p></p><p><p>Patrick McGilligan is the author of <em>Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness</em> <em>and Light</em>; <em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</em>; and <em>George Cukor: A Double Life</em>; and books on the lives of directors Nicholas Ray, Robert Altman, and Oscar Micheaux, and actors James Cagney, Jack Nicholson, and Clint Eastwood.

It is the lowest time for the Saxons. Defeated comprehensively by the Vikings who now occupy most of England, Alfred and his very small group of surviving followers retreat to the trackless marshlands of Somerset. There, forced to move restlessly to escape betrayal or detection, using the marsh mists for cover, they travel by small boats from one island refuge to another, hoping that they can regroup and find some more strength and support. Only Uhtred remains resolute. Determined to discover the enemy&#39;s strategies, he draws once again on his Viking upbringing, and attempts to enter the Viking camps. His plan is to become accepted by their leaders, and to sit in their councils and uncover their plans. But once there, the attractions of his many friends among the Vikings coupled with his disillusion with the Saxons&#39; leadership and anger at Alfred&#39;s criticism of his own conduct, draws him back again to his allegiance to the Vikings. The Pale Horseman, an even more powerful and dramatic book than The Last Kingdom, brings both Uhtred and the Saxons&#39; dilemmas vividly to life.</p><p><p> As the last unvanquished piece of England, Wessex is eyed hungrily by the fearsome Viking conquerors. Uhtred, a dispossessed young nobleman, is tied to the imperiled land by birth and marriage but was raised by the Danish invaders&#x2014;and he questions where his allegiance must lie. But blood is his destiny, and when the overwhelming Viking horde attacks out of a wintry darkness, Uhtred must put aside all hatred and distrust and stand beside his embattled country&#x2019;s staunch defender&#x2014;the fugitive King Alfred.</p><p> New York Times bestselling author Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s The Pale Horseman is a gripping, monumental adventure that gives breathtaking life to one of the most important epochs in English history.</p><p> &#x201c;Cornwell&#x2019;s characters are vividly drawn, betrayals lurk around every corner, the humor is as sharp as the swords, and the action is non-stop.&#x201d; &#x2014;NPR</p>Bernard Cornwell worked for BBC Television for seven years, mostly as a producer on the Nationwide programme, before taking charge of the Current Affairs department in Northern Ireland.

But in this intellectual biography by Kathleen Wellman, La Mettrie&#x2014;physician-philosophe&#x2014;emerges as a central figure whose medical approach to philosophical and moral issues had a profound influence on the period and its legacy.<br>Wellman&#x2019;s study presents La Mettrie as an advocate of progressive medical theory and practice who consistently applied his medical concerns to the reform of philosophy, morals, and society. By examining his training with the Dutch physician Hermann Boerhaave, his satires lampooning the ignorance and venality of the medical profession, and his medical treatises on subjects ranging from vertigo to veneral disease, Wellman illuminates the medical roots of La Mettrie&#x2019;s philosophy. She shows how medicine encouraged La Mettrie to undertake an impiricist critique of the philosophical tradition and provided the foundation for a medical materialism that both shaped his understanding of the possibilities of moral and social reform and led him to espouse the cause of the philosophers.<br>Elucidating the medical view of nature, human beings, and society that the Enlightenment and La Mettrie in particular bequethed to the modern world, <i>La Mettrie</i> makes an important contribution to our understanding of both that period and our own.</p><p><p>Kathleen Wellman is Associate Professor of History at Southern Methodist University.</p></p><h2>This Old Quilt: A Heartwarming Celebration of Quilts and Quilting Memories</h2><p>An anthology of stories and memoirs relating to quilts, quilting, quilt folklore, and history that has something for every quilter.

Delany married white poet Marilyn Hacker right out of high school. The interracial couple moved into the city&#39;s new bohemian quarter, the Lower East Side, in summer 1961. Through the decade&#39;s opening years, new art, new sexual practices, new music, and new political awareness burgeoned among the crowded streets and cheap railroad apartments. Beautifully, vividly, insightfully, Delany calls up this era of exploration and adventure as he details his development as a black gay writer in an open marriage, with tertiary walk-ons by Bob Dylan, Stokely Carmichael, W.

By the end of the period covered, <i>The Waste Land</i>, Lawrence's <i>Birds, Beasts and Flowers</i>, Stevens' <i>Harmonium</i>, and Pound's <i>Draft of XVI Cantos</i> had been published, and the first post-Eliot generation of poets was beginning to emerge. </p><p> More than a hundred poets are treated in this volume, and many more are noticed in passing. Mr. Perkins discusses each poet and type of poetry with keen critical appreciation. He traces opposed and evolving assumptions about poetry, and considers the effects on poetry of its changing audiences, of premises and procedures in literary criticism, of the publishing outlets poets could hope to use, and the interrelations of poetry with developments in the other arts--the novel, painting, film, music--as well as in social, political, and intellectual life. The poetry of the United States and that of the British Isles are seen in interplay rather than separately. </p><p> This book is an important contribution to the understanding of modern literature. At the same time, it throws new light on the cultural history of both America and Britain in the twentieth century. </p></p><p>Embracing an exciting era of poetic ferment, this book traces the modern movement from its beginnings to its vital prime.<b>David Perkins</b> is John P.

This collection contains Follett&#39;s original essays, along with commentaries by Peter F. Drucker, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, and others.</p><p>This book aims to return Follett to her rightful place in the pantheon of classic business writers. A preface by Rosabeth Moss Kanter and an introduction by Peter Drucker attest to the fact that she merits such attention. The book contains extracts of Follett's writings on specific subjects: conflict, authority, power, and the place of the individual in society and the group. Each extract is followed by commentaries from today's foremost management scholars that underscore the contemporary significance of her ideas. Follett espoused the theory that business was a social institution and advocated an almost complete change of vocabulary in the business world, eliminating terms like grievance and complaints since such words led to automatic negative reactions. Since Follett wrote about the human side of management, there have been several "discoveries" that promote her essential philosophy: the participative management movement of the Fifties and Sixties, the quality-of-work movement of the Seventies, and now the network movement?each of these moving organizations toward a new, more effective, and humane form of management. This extraordinary book belongs in all academic management libraries and any others aspiring to have comprehensive management collections.?Mary Chatfield, Angelo State Univ., San Angelo, Tex.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.What's old becomes new again, a remarkable occurrence in the relatively young field of management. To witness the recycling of ideas from such neglected visionaries as Bostonian Mary Parker Follett, one has only to look at the resurgency of total quality management--and its real roots. Editor Graham selects 11 of Follett's lecture essays delivered or published between 1925 and 1933 that prove without a doubt that the concepts of "empowerment" and "horizontal management" began with her.

Whether one is in harmony with the world or not depends upon one's relative emotional and spiritual health. For this reason, the core teachings of Buddhism have always emphasized various forms of mind training. In <i>Transforming the Mind</i>, based on an edited series of his lectures, the Dalai Lama provides a succinct overview of the basic techniques of spiritual development in Tibetan Buddhism. He introduces several aspects of mind training, combining the insights of traditional scholarship with his personal warmth and humanity.<p> The book begins with a lucid account of the basic teachings of Buddhism--the nature of the human predicament and how it can be overcome. Then two key aspects of mind training involving the development of altruism and insight are described. This is essential, since Buddhism teaches that true mental transformation requires a sense of responsibility for others, together with the attainment of insight into the dynamic working of the human psyche and the world. Included in the book is the short traditional text on mental transformation, which the Dalai Lama used to structure his illuminating presentation of Buddhist practice. As an added bonus, the book concludes with a message for the millennium, giving the Dalai Lama's views on the role of Buddhist-inspired ethics in this newly dawning era.</p><p> Though not aimed at complete beginners, this book will appeal to readers who are seriously committed to bringing about change in the world through developing their own spiritual capabilities, whether they are Buddhists or not. <i>--Stephen Hodge, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1989. He is the author of many books about Buddhism.

He is a trained lawyer and former crime correspondent, best known for his general books on legal topics (a history of Interpol and LAW WITHOUT A LAWYER). He is fluent in French and has, since childhood, nursed a passion for the subject.A fresh and lively look at the other Napoleon, by London journalist Bresler (Who Killed John Lennon?, 1989, etc.) For all those who know nothing of the Second Empire beyond furniture, Bresler offers a thoroughly enjoyable look at Napoleon's nephew, Louis Napoleon, who became first President and then Emperor of France from 1848 to 1870. Bresler begins by elucidating the facts of Napoleon's birth and pre-birth (Napoleon III's spawning was orchestrated by his Emperor-uncle, who needed a male heir to the throne, but was unable to conceive one at the time, through an arranged marriage between his stepdaughter and his brother), then covers his childhood and exile in England. The account picks up steam upon Napoleon's return to France during the tumultuous 1848 revolutions, when he was championed by the monarchists. He was first elected to the Assembly, then to the Presidency, and crowned Emperor when the Constitution was invalidated. Under his reign, France's economy expanded, Paris was modernizedalthough he also managed to embroil France in a variety of conflicts including the Crimean War, the annexation of Savoy and Nice, and the thoroughly ill-conceived expedition to Mexico. The perverse masterstroke for which he will forever be remembered was his declaration of war on Prussia, which caused his swift downfall when he showed little of his uncle's military prowess. Bresler, through his use of both published and unpublished sources, shows Napoleon III to be a brave and compelling leader, a canny politician, and an unselfish sovereignas one modern critic described him, ``a nineteenth-century De Gaulle, dedicated only to fulfilling his country's greatness.'' A fascinating look at Second Empire France and the little-studied ``petit-Napoleon.'' -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Why would any artist choose to work with slides? </b></p><p>It&#x2019;s tempting to see slide projection as quick and easy. Indeed, many artists cite these qualities when explaining their initial attraction to the medium. But the process can be complicated, involving not only the creation of the transparency itself but also its arrangement, projected scale, and timing. A single carousel may contain as many as eighty images that must be numbered and ordered, a task that grows all the more complicated with the addition of each new slide grouping. When we rediscovered a piece by one of the performance artists in the exhibition, I thought he was going to cry. The prospect of putting the whole complex thing back together was painful, even though he was delighted to see his work again. Of course, slide projection is low-tech and notoriously accident-prone. But I think the medium owes a lot of its immediacy to its tendency as an apparatus to jam, to burn out a bulb, to turn a well-planned show into a logistical nightmare. Good art often courts disaster. </p><p><b>Is the development of slide art connected to the ferment of the 60s? </b></p><p>During the 1960s and 1970s, public projection of slides became a vehicle for social and political activism. Slide projection&#x2019;s portability made this possible, enabling artists (Krzysztof Wodiczko, for example) to project powerful, challenging images onto public buildings. When Lucy Lippard wanted to publicize the exclusion of women from the Whitney Annual of 1970, she projected slides against the surface of the museum to protest its curatorial policies. This application of slides as critical commentary had historical precedents: in the 1880s, the photographer Jacob Riis used slides of the urban poor to arouse the concern of people who might have been able to help.</p><p><b>Did the strong associations of slides with family entertainment have any impact on the ways artists adapted the medium? </b></p><p>The fact that the medium promotes a collective viewing experience is important for both artists and popular users. The act of looking at images, especially still photographs, generally involves a single spectator and a stationary object, but with slides you are often sitting in the same room with other people, sharing the experience with them. People who watch Nan Goldin&#x2019;s <em>The Ballad of Sexual Dependency</em>, for example, find themselves on the same emotional roller coaster. It&#x2019;s like the family slide show in a way; people participate in a joint emotional response to images of past events. Of course, the memories and feelings such a work stimulates are different for everyone, and that is the reason <b>The Ballad</b> is such a great piece. Marcel Proust as well as Ingmar Bergman have called attention to the mesmerizing power of the magic lantern shows they saw as children. </p><p><b>Is there any connection between those shows and slide shows by such artists as Dennis Oppenheim or James Coleman?</b></p><p>Projection is a mysterious process that evokes all kinds of fantasies. The ancient meaning of the term &#x201c;to project&#x201d; is related to the alchemical process for changing base metal into gold. Nearly every artist I interviewed remembers being fascinated by shadows on the wall as a kid, or lying in the dark using the beam of a flashlight to make patterns in the darkness. An artist like James Coleman extends this magical experience to viewers by manipulating the transformative properties of slides as images that are not quite real; indeed, the projections themselves are totally intangible. But all the works in the exhibition invite viewers to read meaning into translucent pictures.</p><p><b>Is slide technology a thing of the past? </b></p><p>Over the past five years, at least, PowerPoint presentations have supplanted slide shows. PowerPoint facilitates overlays, dissolves, syncopated fades, and collage. As consumers, we have become accustomed to a barrage of images and are easily bored. No matter how fancy your equipment, slide projection will always seem a slower, more regulated process. Slides and slide projectors are generally a monocular form of vision and, though users can combine projectors to multiply the frames they project, it is rare that people&#x2014;including artists&#x2014;use more than two. And please remember: anyone who would like to use a projector must go to the secondhand market. The last slide projector was manufactured in September 2004. </p><p><b>How does the book </b><b><em>SlideShow </em></b><b>relate to the SlideShow exhibition? </b></p><p>I am not trying to replicate the exhibition in a book; that&#x2019;s impossible! The book cannot but give its reader a visual experience radically different from that afforded viewers of the exhibition.

She turned, shrugged her leather satchel higher onto her shoulder, and passed a simmering glance over the galleried coaching inn with its double tier of white-painted balustrades as a pair of postboys dashed out to assist her.<br><br>&#x201c;My luggage, please,&#x201d; she ordered, heedless of them gawking at her slender figure wrapped in a ruby velvet redingote with rich sable fur at collar and cuffs. She paid the coachman, then marched across the cobbled yard, her guinea-gold corkscrew curls bouncing with her every determined stride.<br><br>At the threshold of the busy inn, she paused, warily scanning the motley assortment of bickering, rumpled travelers. A child squalled on his mother&#x2019;s hip; plain, rustic-looking folk dozed on chairs and benches waiting for their stagecoaches to depart. A drunkard was making a nuisance of himself in one corner, while a beggar boy had crept in to escape the damp chill and huddled near the crackling hearth.<br><br>Lifting her chin a trifle self-consciously, she proceeded into the long room among what her count- less wellborn beaux would have called &#x201c;the Great Unwashed.&#x201d; She felt their stares following her, some rude, some merely curious. She noticed a man squinting at her feet as she passed and realized that beneath the long hem of her coat, her gold satin dancing slippers were visible.<br><br>She gave him a scowl that suggested he mind his own business and yanked the fur-trimmed hem over her toes. Doing her best to keep her feet tucked out of sight, she strode to the high wooden counter, where the booking agent sat ignoring the lobby&#x2019;s chaos, safely hidden behind a crinkled copy of the London Times. Above him hung a chalkboard scrawled with a timetable of arrivals and departures, fares and destinations.<br><br>Jacinda tugged briskly at her gloves and hoped she looked like she knew what she was doing. &#x201c;Yes, excuse me, I require passage to Dover.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stage leaves at two,&#x201d; he grunted without lowering his paper.<br><br>Her eyes widened at such rude, poor service. &#x201c;You misapprehend me, sir. I wish to hire a post chaise.&#x201d;<br><br>This got his attention, for only the wealthy could afford to hire the yellow-painted private carriages. He peered over his paper, then heaved up out of his chair and slouched over to attend her just as the two post-boys came laboring in under her hastily packed traveling trunks. The booking agent plucked his quill pen out of the inkpot and wiped his nose with ink-stained fingers. &#x201c;Destination?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dover,&#x201d; she repeated crisply. &#x201c;How soon can the chaise be made ready?&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced over his shoulder at the dusty wall-clock, then shrugged. &#x201c;Twenty minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shall want four horses and two postilions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll cost ye extra.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It does not signify.&#x201d; Absently pulling her small leather money purse out of her satchel, she hurried to tip the postboys.<br><br>The booking agent&#x2019;s eyes glazed over as he stared at her purse, plump with gold guineas and bright silver crowns and shillings. His quill pen hovered over the blank waybill, his whole demeanor improving at once. &#x201c;Ahem, my lady&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Smith,&#x201d; she lied evenly. &#x201c;Miss. Jane. Smith.&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced around for her chaperon, footman, or maid, of which, for once in her life, praise heaven, she had none. He raised his scraggly eyebrows. &#x201c;Will Miss Smith be traveling alone, then?&#x201d;<br><br>She lifted her chin a notch. &#x201c;Quite so.&#x201d;<br><br>His dubious look alarmed her. Holding his gaze like a seasoned gamester, Jacinda slid a few coins across his desk. Pursing his mouth, he pocketed them with no further questions, and she breathed a sigh of relief. Then the booking agent entered her alias in his logbook and copied it onto the waybill. This done, he pointed with his quill pen to her two traveling trunks piled behind her. &#x201c;That all your baggage, Miss, er, Smith?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, laying her gloved hand oh-so-casually over the gilt-tooled coat of arms emblazoned near the clasp. Hiding her family crest from his view, she waited until he bent his head again to continue filling out the waybill, for if he saw it, she knew that no bribe would be sufficient to dissuade him from sending back to Almack&#x2019;s for her tribe of formidable elder brothers, who would come rushing to drag her home in a trice. Aiding and abetting her escape, after all, was akin to crossing all five of the Knight brothers, a blunder no man in the realm dared make; but Jacinda refused to be thwarted. She was going to Dover and thence to Calais, and no one was going to stop her.<br><br>Soon the booking agent had collected her payment and had sent the lads out to ready the chaise. While they bore her trunks away to be loaded into the boot, she paced restlessly in the lobby, nearly jumping out of her skin each time the tinny horn blew, announcing another stagecoach&#x2019;s arrival or departure.<br><br>Since she had a bit of a wait, she sat down on the bench by the wall beneath the candle-branch. Loosening the ribbons of her bonnet, she reached into her satchel and pulled out her beloved, well-worn copy of Lord Byron&#x2019;s The Corsair to read a bit while she waited. She tried to lose herself in the romance of the dashing outlaw, but she could not concentrate with the excitement of her adventure racing through her veins.<br><br>Nervously, she checked her travel documents one more time, securely tucked between the pages of the book, while memories of her Continental tour danced through her head. Two years ago, her straitlaced eldest brother and main guardian, Robert, the duke of Hawkscliffe, had been assigned to the British delegation at the Congress of Vienna. He had taken his wife, Bel; Jacinda; and her companion, Lizzie, with him on the trip to enjoy the lavish festivities celebrating the end of the war. With Napoleon locked away at last, it had been safe again to tour the Continent. Robert had led them on a roundabout course to the Austrian capital, visiting some of the most important and beautiful cities of Europe along the way&#x2014;and at each one, a whole new crop of charming young gentlemen to flirt with, she thought in wicked pleasure. What fun it had been&#x2014;though blind Cupid, devil take him, had continually missed her heart with his golden arrows. Of all the places she had seen, Paris, the city her mother had loved, had been holy ground to Jacinda.<br><br>Soon, she thought dreamily, she would be in Paris again, among her mother&#x2019;s glamorous friends of the decimated French aristocracy. At last, she would be free. By heaven, she would not stay here and be forced to marry Lord Griffith, no matter how perfect he was or how advantageous the match, for their families&#x2019; lands adjoined each other in the northern wilds of Cumberland; no matter, even, that he was the only man her brothers unanimously trusted to become her husband, their friend from boyhood days and on through Eton and Oxford.<br><br>A handsome, sophisticated man of nearly forty, Ian Prescott, the marquess of Griffith, was possessed of a cool, steady temperament that was just the thing, her brothers had decided, to balance her &#x201c;youthful passions&#x201d; and &#x201c;headstrong ways.&#x201d; For his part, Ian was tranquilly prepared to marry her whenever she was deemed ready and willing, but Jacinda refused to be given in holy matrimony to one who was not her love, not her soul mate, but a man she thought of as an extra brother&#x2014;yet another skilled, patient guardian who would gently tell her what to do, make all her decisions for her, try to buy her obedience with expensive baubles, and treat her like a pretty little fool.<br><br>Tonight at Almack&#x2019;s, in the hopes that it was the one place she would not dare make a scene, Robert had told her that after her recent bit of mischief at Ascot, the much-anticipated match between their two powerful families must no longer be delayed. The negotiations for her marriage settlement were almost finished, he had said, and tomorrow they would set the wedding date. She had been nothing less than shocked.<br><br>The problem with her brothers was that they were a hundred times too protective and could not take a joke where she was concerned. It had been nothing but harmless fun, that day at the horse races, she thought innocently.<br><br>Informed of her fate, however, she had instantly realized drastic action was in order. There was no reasoning with Robert when he got that holier-than-thou look in his eyes. His wrathful gaze and rum- bling tone had reminded her afresh that he was not merely the starchy, lovable eldest brother whom she had cheerfully tormented throughout her childhood; he was also one of the most powerful men in England, an imperious, august personage whom even the prince regent found intimidating. So, she had slipped out of Almack&#x2019;s; run all the way home; hastily packed her things; and whistled for the first hackney that came rolling down St. James&#x2019;s Street around the corner from her home, the imposing Knight House on Green Park.<br><br>&#x201c;Spare a penny, m&#x2019;um?&#x201d;<br><br>Startled out of her thoughts by a small, timid voice, she looked up from her traveling documents and instantly suffered a pang of compassion. Before her stood the bedraggled street urchin who, earlier, had been crouching by the hearth fire. The child stared at her imploringly, his small, grimy hand held out in hopeful expectation. He looked about nine years old. His puppy-dog eyes were huge and brown, his little face smudged with dirt. His filthy clothes, little more than rags, hung off of his bony frame like a scarecrow&#x2019;s. His grimy feet were bare. Her heart clenched.<br><br>Poor, miserable pup.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, m&#x2019;um?&#x201d; The pitiful thing shivered and sent a furtive glance over his shoulder at the booking agent, as though afraid of being noticed and thrown off the premises.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, my dear,&#x201d; she murmured tenderly, opening her satchel at once. She pulled out her embarrassingly fat change purse and picked out three shiny gold guineas&#x2014;then a fourth. It was as much as she could spare with the long and costly journey to France ahead of her.<br><br>The boy stared, wide-eyed, at the small fortune of gleaming coins, but made no move to take it, as though he didn&#x2019;t dare.<br><br>Her gaze softened at his mistrust. Clearly, the child had known little of kindness. Loosely holding her money purse in her left hand, she held out her right, offering him the coins. &#x201c;Go on, take it,&#x201d; she coaxed gently, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s all right&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly his grubby hand shot out and snatched her money purse. He bolted off across the lobby in an instant, her coin purse clutched tightly to his chest. Her jaw dropped. For a second, she could only stand there in shock, left holding nothing but the four gold coins she had meant to give to him. Sheer outrage exploded through her veins.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop, thief!&#x201d;<br><br>Nobody paid her the slightest attention, and it was altogether possible that this shocked her even more than the theft.<br><br>Her eyes narrowed to blazing slashes. &#x201c;Right!&#x201d; she muttered under her breath. Slinging her satchel over her shoulder lest it be stolen, too, she dashed out after the little pilferer herself. A moment later, she burst out into the clammy April night and saw the boy pounding across the sprawling innyard.<br><br>&#x201c;You, sirrah! Stop this instant!&#x201d;<br><br>She heard a trail of triumphant laughter as the scamp flashed out of sight around the corner of the inn- yard&#x2019;s enclosing wall. He was as quick as a cat, apparently accustomed to fleeing for his life. She picked up her skirts and raced after him over the dewy cobbles, but she might as well have been barefoot, for her dancing slippers were instantly soaked and torn.<br><br>Her untied bonnet fell off and went tumbling down her back. She left it where it lay and flung around the high brick wall. There was a fortune in that purse. Without it, her plans were a shambles.<br><br>She saw him racing up Drury Lane. &#x201c;Come back here, you little savage!&#x201d; Dodging an arriving stagecoach, she kept her gaze fixed on the child, pouring on all the speed she could rally, her satchel bumping against her side.<br><br>Insolent as brass, the pickpocket glanced over his shoulder and saw her gaining on him. Taking evasive action, he ducked into a dingy side street, but Jacinda would not be shaken, heedlessly following him deeper and deeper into a maze of dark lanes and cramped, twisting alleyways, for it was a matter of pride now. She would not be gulled and robbed blind by a mere street arab. Not after the night she was having.<br><br>Giving chase with the same stubborn determination that had earned her a reputation as a sportswoman of superior skill at riding to the hounds, she ignored each pounding jolt to her knees and hollered after him again like a fishmonger&#x2019;s wife, her breath beginning to strain against her light stays. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know you could be hanged for this, you little heathen?&#x201d;<br><br>He ignored her, weaving nimbly through a series of narrow, twisting passageways into the seedy back alleys toward Covent Garden Market. Here piles of litter crawling with rats lined the cramped brick walls, but Jacinda barely noticed them, all her focus trained on her wily quarry.<br><br>Malnourished as he was, the boy soon began to tire. Urged on by imminent victory, Jacinda poured on a fresh burst of speed, her fingertips grazing him. He glanced wildly over his shoulder. Surging forward, she caught him suddenly, seizing the back of his filthy coat collar.</p><h2>JOSEPH SMITH THE PROPHET (TALK ON CD)</h2><p>The prophecies of Joseph Smith the prophet as told and interpreted by the well know Mormon scholar Truman G.

Be assured that <i>YOU: Having a Baby </i>will be one of your favorite passengers on this wonderful ride. <br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive Essay from Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz, Authors of <i>YOU: Having a Baby</i></b></p> <p>While many pregnancy books tell you what to do, we aim to add a deeper level of meaning in true <i>YOU</i> style and explain why. After all, when you truly understand the why, the what is much easier to adopt. Instead of giving you a week-by-week or hiccup-by-hiccup guide to pregnancy, we take a more holistic approach, focusing on how your mental and physical health affect your baby, and how--at the same time--pregnancy affects your mind and body. Of course, we provide plenty of our signature YOU Tips and YOU Tools to help you make the best choices for a safe and healthy pregnancy, but we're going to take you there a little bit differently than other pregnancy guides may. Here's what you can expect from us:</p> <p>We want you to understand at the base level how epigenetics works and why it's important. Starting with the moment you go from making love to making a baby, we explain how you can influence your child's development through this field--perhaps the most important developed in the last decade. Many of us believe that the genetics of our children are predetermined the moment that the sperm locks on its desired egg. But the truth is that research from various sources is suggesting that during pregnancy, you may actually be able to turn your future baby's genes on and off--you have the ability to control genes anytime.</p> <p>You'll also learn quite a bit about the key player that mediates between you and your baby, transmitting all signals that create those epigenetic changes. That player is the placenta. This beautifully functioning organ is the place where mom and child interact, where nutrients are exchanged, and where growth and development patterns are determined.</p> <p>After explaining the workings of the placenta, we'll focus more closely on nutrition (both yours and baby's), explaining how too much, too little, or the wrong nutrients all play roles in the health of both you and your child. We also talk about such things as fetal brain development, how to manage (and prevent) postpartum depression, and important pregnancy-related medical conditions like gestational diabetes.</p> <p>In the second half of the book, we'll help you manage the wide range of side effects you may be feeling--everything from heartburn and insomnia to medical complications like preeclampsia. Finally, we present a bunch of great features you can use, including:</p> <p><b>Broadway to Birth</b>: Our interactive board game will take you through the amazing adventure that is labor and delivery to help you understand which elements you can control and which elements you need to leave to the pros (whom we'll help you choose, based on your own labor and delivery goals).</p> <p><b>A Top Eight List of Postpartum Issues</b>: After you deliver your baby, you'll appreciate our chapter on everything you need to know to take care of yourself and your newborn in the first month of life. This is where the second adventure begins.</p> <p><b>The Ultimate Pregnancy Flight Plan</b>: Step by step, we provide the instructional dials, controls, and levers that will allow you to pilot your way to a safe landing. After all, you're carrying a very precious passenger. This plan is the shorthand version of all the best tips and strategies we give throughout the book.</p> <p><b>YOU Tools</b>: At the end of the book, we will give you specific advice about exercise, diet, vitamins, and the like that can serve as an action plan. We also provide guidance on everything from choosing a doctor or midwife to preparing your home for a baby to recipes your partner can make for you during your pregnancy.</p> <p>We want you to relax and take time to enjoy the beauty of the pregnancy process. The most important thing to keep in mind is that most pregnancies turn out absolutely fine. <i>Absolutely fine</i>. Women's bodies are designed to carry children safely and efficiently. That doesn't mean everything will be smooth sailing on this journey, but it does mean that the odds are greatly in your favor. If you can learn how to maximize your chances that nature runs the course it's supposed to, you will increase those odds even further. This book will help show you how.</p> <i>-Michael F.

This is Maloney&#x2019;s fourth book aimed at the sewing-kid crowd. (Jennifer Forker <i>Associated Press, December 2014</i>)<br><br>With two previous sewing books (Socks Appeal and Sock it to Me!) under her belt, Maloney is well positioned to create a worthwhile book on sewing for kids. Her effort is as charming as can be, combining clear instructions and adorable patterns with a series of stories about the titular protagonist. The book begins with a winning and short overview of sewing skills: "My editors tell me that it's very important that I teach you the proper words for things," she writes. Then readers will learn how to make Mouse as well as a cast of other characters (snakes, penguins, aliens) who appear in a jungle, at the North Pole, and in space. While the instructions are shown in step-by-step photos, the projects still might require an adult's help. Maloney has cleverly designed projects that can be hand or machine-sewn, and that appear to be accessible to beginners. She notes at the beginning that the editors have allowed her to "write the books I always wanted to read." She's not alone; many other young sewists will want to read this one, too.

Translated into thirty languages, it has sold over nine million copies worldwide and lives on as a science book that continues to captivate and inspire new readers each year. When it was first published in 1988 the ideas discussed in it were at the cutting edge of what was then known about the universe. In the intervening ten years there have been extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and macro-cosmic world. Indeed, during that time cosmology and the theoretical sciences have entered a new golden age. Professor Hawking is one of the major scientists and thinkers to have contributed to this renaissance. In this special, fully updated edition, which marks the tenth anniversary of the book&#39;s original ground-breaking publication, Professor Hawking has included the most recent developments in the field, many of which were forecast by him. He has also written a new introduction as well as an additional chapter on wormholes and time travel. A Brief History of Time has rightly been hailed as the publishing sensation of the past decade and is surely destined to become one of the greatest classics of science writing.</p><p>Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history, wrote the modern classic <i>A Brief History of Time</i> to help nonscientists understand the questions being asked by scientists today: Where did the universe come from? How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end, and if so, how? Hawking attempts to reveal these questions (and where we're looking for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, the nature of time, and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. This is <i>deep</i> science; these concepts are so vast (or so tiny) as to cause vertigo while reading, and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking, for, as Hawking says, the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of "the mind of God." <i>--Therese Littleton</i>"A Brief History of Time, published in 1988, was a landmark volume in science writing and in world-wide acclaim and popularity, with more than 9 million copies in print globally. The original edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the ensuing years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world--observations that have confirmed many of Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book. <br>Now a decade later, this edition updates the chapters throughout to document those advances, and also includes an entirely new chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel and a new introduction. It make vividly clear why "A Brief History of Time has transformed our view of the universe.</p><h2>Devil&#39;s Cup, The (A Hawkenlye Mystery, 17)</h2><p><b><i>Sir Josse d&#x2019;Aquin is summoned to assist the beleaguered King John in the 17th &#x2013; and final &#x2013; Hawkenlye mystery.</i></b> <br><br> September, 1216.

As the war against the Taurans sends him from galaxy to galaxy, he learns to use protective body shells and sophisticated weapons. He adapts to the cultures and terrains of distant outposts. But with each month in space, years are passing on Earth. Where will he call home when (and if) the Forever War ends? Narrator George Wilson&#x2019;s performance conveys all the imaginative technology and human drama of <i>The Forever War</i>. Set against a backdrop of vivid battle scenes, this absorbing work asks provocative questions about the very nature of war.</p></p><p>In the 1970s Joe Haldeman approached more than a dozen different publishers before he finally found one interested in <em>The Forever War</em>. The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication. Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version of <em>The Forever War</em>, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended. The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans. Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship. For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can't adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass. <em>--Craig E.

Above all else, Kajiwara emphasizes the importance of careful analysis in order to determine the correct direction of play, that is, the direction in which a stone or a group of stones exerts its main influence. He demonstrates that each stone has a life of its own and so expresses the individuality of the player. The key to a powerful game is understanding the relationship between each stone and the overall position, for only then can one realize the full potential of every stone that one plays.</p><p>Takeo Kajiwara was born in 1923 in Niigata Prefecture in Japan.

Over seven chapters, Gill skillfully shifts (and draws parallels) between Reeves&#x2019;s childhood as a slave and his adult service as a marshal; two hard-hitting motifs are a menacing, avian Jim Crow figure and a pickaninny caricature, the latter used as a rebus-style replacement for racial epithets in the dialogue [...] A bibliography is included for readers seeking to learn more about Reeves.

The author's previous book, Strange Fruit, contains a mini-biography on Bass Reeves and this book takes the same story, expounds upon it and fills in more details. An interesting, informative and exciting tale of a man not that well known to history. Looking forward to seeing who the next volume will be about. - Nicola Mansfield, <i>It's All Comic To Me</i> blog<br><br>Gr 7 Up Expanding upon the short entry that appeared in his Strange Fruit: Uncelebrated Narratives from Black History (Fulcrum, 2014), Gill opens his new graphic novels series on African American heroes with a volume about Bass Reeves, a former slave and the first black U.S. Marshall. With alternating full-page spreads and varied panels, the tale switches between 1902 (during his time as a lawman) and the 1840s (when Reeves first learned how to shoot as an enslaved child). The narrative details Reeves&#x2019;s adventures as his master&#x2019;s prized possession, eventual escape, experiences living with Native Americans, fighting for the North in the Civil War, and then as a rough and tough officer of the law (rumored to be the inspiration for The Lone Ranger). The folkloric, tall tale tone of the text is enhanced by the earthy illustrations and the pictographs that serve as substitutes for racial slurs a blackface-type head for the n-word and an American Indian in headdress for redskins.&#x201d; Even more striking is a man-size crow character who symbolizes Jim Crow racism and practices of the time and plagues the subject throughout his life. Time jumps are sometimes confusing, as the color schemes of the two time lines are similar, but the format, unique perspective, and back matter make this title a prime candidate for school reports, strengthening American history collections, and reluctant readers of biographies.

This "age of genius," from its origins in the thirteenth century to its zenith in sixteenth-century Rome, produced some of the most fascinating and dynamic artists of all time--Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and Leonardo da Vinci. In his adventurous new book, lavishly illustrated with 125 color illustrations, acclaimed art critic Andrew Graham-Dixon takes a fresh look at this most exciting period in art history, challenging many of the myths and misconceptions surrounding the Renaissance.<br><br>The Italian scholars who first dreamed of a Renaissance wished to revive the spirit of classical antiquity after the darkness--as they saw it--of the medieval and Byzantine periods. Graham-Dixon argues, however, that the Renaissance represented a culmination rather than a complete rejection of those earlier influences. Starting in the Middle Ages with the impact of the Franciscan movement on painting in Italy, Graham-Dixon's reappraisal of the Renaissance takes us through the key moments of its development, focusing on the major artists and architects of the time: the Early Renaissance in Florence--Giotto, Masaccio, Donatello, and Brunelleschi; the Northern Renaissance--D�rer, Cranach, and Brueghel; Venice--Titian, Palladio, and Tintoretto; and the High Renaissance in Rome--Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.<br><br><i>Renaissance</i> also outlines the historical context of this time of great social as well as artistic change. It reveals the social climate in which these artists worked: the power struggles between the Renaissance rulers of the Italian city-states, the French invasions of Italy, the invention of printing, and the Protestant Reformation. Along with his vivid, highly original, and often extremely entertaining descriptions of the works themselves, Graham-Dixon not only reassesses but also brings to life one of the most glorious periods in history.<br><br></p><p>"<i>Renaissance</i> reflects the intensely personal and passionate involvement of the author in his subject. In his analysis and his judgments, Graham-Dixon is original, daring, occasionally iconoclastic, and never dull or pedantic. The result is a book both more spirited and more accessible than Kenneth Clark's <i>Civilization</i>."

The only clues are its left-handed tuners and the salesman&#x2019;s chance remark that the guitar was brought into the shop by a Hendrix roadie. But these are enough to set the author off on this intriguing journey into Hendrix history.<br><br>With firsthand details from model Linda Keith, who discovered Hendrix in New York, Adams recounts how the rising star left for London with a white Stratocaster belonging to Keith Richards. The man who made Hendrix&#x2019;s pedals explains how this Strat failed to make the &#x201c;Purple Haze&#x201d; recording session and how it was replaced by a borrowed Telecaster. As Adams tracks down the surviving musicians, they shed light on the fate of that Telecaster and gradually the two guitars begin to merge into one. Throughout, Adams weaves his own story as a rock musician and tells how, against the odds, he managed to hold on to this remarkable instrument.<br><br>Here is a riveting story of one man seeking the truth about a cultural artifact that changed rock history, a story for rock fans and guitar aficionados, treasure hunters and antique dealers, as well as anyone who likes a detective story.<br></p><p>Chris Adams was the driving force behind the early 1970s folk-rock band String Driven Thing, which toured extensively in Europe and the United States, regularly opening for Genesis. Later, opening a recording studio, Chris Adams earned his living as a songwriter. In the early 1990s he reformed the band and they are active both on the live and recording fronts. He lives in Glasgow, Scotland.In 1973, Adams bought a guitar from a music store in London. The salesman mentioned that the guitar had been brought in by one of Jimi Hendrix&#x2019;s roadies. It was a maybe-it&#x2019;s-true curiosity, and the author talked about the possible Hendrix connection from time to time as the years passed. Forty years later, though, he learned that a lot of Hendrix fans were debating the existence of a (possibly mythical) 'lost' guitar, one used by Hendrix at some London recording sessions that had disappeared in the early 1970s. Could Adams have bought that guitar? He was determined to find out. This endlessly fascinating account of his search for the truth is structured like a police procedural: Adams finds clues, follows leads, and interviews people who might know something. It&#x2019;s the story of a guitar, sure, but it&#x2019;s also the story of a music subculture, of a global fan collective whose devotion to a long-dead musician has shaped their lives. It&#x2019;s not often that you can say about a music book that readers will be impatiently turning the pages, anxious to see how the story plays out, but that&#x2019;s exactly what happens here. (<i>Booklist, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>Musician Adams's fascinating search for the provenance of his beloved and battered Fender Telecaster&#x2014;which may or may not have been owned by guitar hero Jimi Hendrix&#x2014;is equal parts cultural history and detective story, and it's completely compelling reading. Adams's quest for the history of his 'grail' begins almost 40 years after he found the guitar in 1973 in a London music store, where a salesman casually tells Adams he got it from 'one of Hendrix's roadies.' At the time, Adams was guitarist in the folk-rock band String Driven Thing, and his knowledge of the late 1960s music scene serves him well as he and a researcher friend&#x2014;inspired decades later by rumors about 'Jimi's lost Tele'&#x2014;comb through Hendrix biographies and Internet sites. They discover a few solid facts in the chaos of Hendrix history: that Jimi used a Telecaster on overdubs on the 'Purple Haze' recording, even though his guitar of choice was the Fender Stratocaster; that Hendrix bass player Noel Redding had procured the guitar from a friend for the session; that Redding ended up with the guitar after he had stopped playing with Hendrix; and that Redding had probably sold it to an actual Hendrix roadie. As Adams traces the guitar's journey through the 1960s&#x2014;including a day-glo paint refinishing&#x2014;he successfully rescues 'this little piece of rock history for posterity.' (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Even 45 years since his death, Hendrix books still come thick and fast, most unable to provide much exciting new insight into the greatest guitarist the world has ever seen. But former String Driven Thing guitarist Chris Adams has a genuinely interesting tale to tell and produces a book that Jimi geeks ill salivate over.... Adams deftly weaves in Hendrix's story, from hitting the UK with the white Stratocaster Linda 'borrowed' from then-boyfriend Keith Richards, then the triumphs, nightmares, and dodgy business shenanigans which plagues Hendrix until his death and beyond. He emerges with a compelling book that manages to combine ace detective work, relentlessly diligent endeavor and, crucially, tantalising morsels of new information. Unreservedly recommended for Hendrix buffs. (<i>Shindig! Magazine</i>)<br><br>The growth and the development of the internet is responsible for many things, and one of the benefits of the possibilities of the world wide web is the existence of books like this, where something said over a 3rd hand telecaster can lead to the amount of detective work that would put a Raymond Chandler private eye to shame. If you add one of the most revered and iconic figures in rock history to the mix, then there will be a lot of interest, from fans of the guitar, rock music, and the Sixties and the Seventies. . . .There is a lot to be said for this book, both as a historical record of the bands and musicians who worked with Hendrix, and the times in the 1960s and 1970s and for shedding light on some of the musicians and players that plied their trade in the shadows of one of the giants of rock music. (<i>Muso's Guide</i>)<br><br>[The Grail Guitar: The Search for Jimi Hendrix&#x2019;s Purple Haze Telecaster]makes for a interesting mix of musical history and detective novel that form this intriguing read. (<i>My Big Honkin Blog</i>)<br><br>In 1973 author Adams, at the time the guitarist for String Driven Thing, bought a used Telecaster in London after enduring an embarrassing on-stage incident where his only guitar failed on him during a show. Eventually Adams came to believe the guitar was previously played by Jimi Hendrix, and then the possibility came up that it could actually be the guitar that Jimi used on the recording of 'Purple Haze.' The book is the story of Adams' quest to find out the truth about the guitar and the tale is presented in a fun way that reveals insight about Hendrix and other rock 'n' roll luminaries as Adams meets and gleans information from various survivors of the scene. We won't reveal here what Adams determined about the provenance of the guitar but we will reveal that the reader will have a great time tagging along with him during the investigation.

LIFE IN THE TWENTY-SIX STATES</b><br> <br>Although I am writing this in the year 1877, I was not born until 1921. Neither the dates nor the tenses are error--let me explain:<br> <br>I was born, as I say, in 1921, but it was not until the early 1930s, when I was about ten, that I began to understand what a peculiarly frustrated and disinherited world was about me. Perhaps my approach to realization was through the crayon portrait of Granpa Hodgins which hung, very solemnly, over the mantel.<br> <br>Granpa Hodgins, after whom I was named, perhaps a little grandiloquently, Hodgins McCormick Backmaker, had been a veteran of the War of Southron Independence. Like so many young men he had put on a shapeless blue uniform in response to the call of the ill-advised and headstrong--or martyred--Mr. Lincoln. Depending on which of my lives' viewpoints you take.<br> <br>Granpa lost an arm on the Great Retreat to Philadelphia after the fall of Washington to General Lee's victorious Army of Northern Virginia, so his war ended some six months before the capitulation at Reading and the acknowledgment of the independence of the Confederate States on July 4, 1864. One-armed and embittered, Granpa came home to Wappinger Falls and, like his fellow veterans, tried to remake his life in a different and increasingly hopeless world.<br> <br>On its face the Peace of Richmond was a just and even generous disposition of a defeated foe by the victor. (Both sides--for different reasons--remembered the mutiny of the Unreconstructed Federals in the Armies of the Cumberland and the Tennessee who, despite defeat at Chattanooga, could not forget Vicksburg or Port Hudson and fought bloodily against the order to surrender.) The South could easily have carved the country up to suit its most fiery patriots, even to the point of detaching the West and making a protectorate of it. Instead, the chivalrous Southrons contented themselves with drawing the new boundary along traditional lines. The Mason-Dixon gave them Delaware and Maryland, but they generously returned the panhandle of western Virginia jutting above it. Missouri was naturally included in the Confederacy, but of the disputed territory Colorado and Deseret were conceded to the old Union; only Kansas and California as well as--for obvious defensive reasons--Nevada's tip went to the South.<br> <br>But the Peace of Richmond had also laid the cost of the war on the beaten North, and this was what crippled Granpa Hodgins more than the loss of his arm. The postwar inflation entered the galloping stage during the Vallandigham Administration, became dizzying in the time of President Seymour, and precipitated the food riots of 1873 and '74. It was only after the election of President Butler by the Whigs in 1876 and the reorganization and drastic deflation following that money and property became stable, but by this time all normal values were destroyed. Meanwhile the indemnities had to be paid regularly in gold. Granpa and hundreds of thousands like him just never seemed to get back on their feet.<br> <br>How well I remember, as a small boy in the 1920s and '30s, my mother and father talking bitterly of how the war had ruined everything. They were not speaking of the then fairly recent Emperors' War of 1914-16, but of the War of Southron Independence which still, nearly seventy years later, blighted what was left of the United States.<br> <br>Nor were they unique or peculiar in this. Men who slouched in the smithy while Father shod their horses, or gathered every month around the post office waiting for the notice of the winning lottery numbers to be put up, as often cursed the Confederates or discussed what might have been if Meade had been a better general or Lee a worse one, as they did the new-type bicycles with clockwork auxiliaries to make pedaling uphill easier, or the latest scandal about the French emperor Napoleon VI. <br><br>I tried to imagine what it must have been like in Granpa Hodgins's day, to visualize the lost past--that strange bright era when, if it could be believed, folk like ourselves and our neighbors had owned their farms outright and didn't pay rent to the bank or give half the crop to a landlord. I searched the wiggling crayon lines that composed Granpa Hodgins's face for some sign that set him apart from his descendants. <br><br>"But what did he do to lose the farm?" I used to ask my mother.<br> <br>"Do? Didn't do anything. Couldn't help himself. Go along now and do your chores; I've a terrible batch of work to get out."<br> <br>How could Granpa's not doing anything result so disastrously? I could not understand this any more than I could the bygone time when a man could nearly always get a job for wages which would support himself and a family, before the system of indenture became so common that practically the only alternative to pauperism was to sell oneself to a company.<br> <br>Indenting I understood all right, for there was a mill in Wappinger Falls which wove a shoddy cloth very different from the goods my mother produced on her hand loom. Mother, even in her late forties, could have indented there for a good price, and she admitted that the work would be easier than weaving homespun to compete with their product. But, as she used to say with an obstinate shake of her head, "Free I was born and free I'll die."<br> <br>In Granpa Hodgins's day, if one could believe the folktales or family legends, men and women married young and had large families; there might have been five generations between him and me instead of two. And many uncles, aunts, cousins, brothers, and sisters. Now late marriages and only children were the rule.<br> <br>If it hadn't been for the war ... This was the basic theme stated with variations suited to the particular circumstance. If it hadn't been for the war the most energetic young men and women would not turn to emigration; visiting foreigners would not come as to a slum; and the great powers would think twice before sending troops to restore order every time one of their citizens was molested. If it hadn't been for the war the detestable buyer from Boston--detestable to my mother, but rather fascinating to me with his brightly colored vest and smell of soap and hair tonic--would not have come regularly to offer her a miserable price for her weaving.<br> <br>"Foreigner!" she would always exclaim after he left; "Sending good cloth out of the country."<br> <br>Once my father ventured, "He's only doing what he's paid for."<br> <br>"Trust a Backmaker to stand up for foreigners. Like father, like son; suppose you'd let the whole thieving crew in if you had your way."<br> <br>So was first hinted the scandal of Grandfather Backmaker. No enlarged portrait of him hung anywhere, much less over the mantel. I got the impression my father's father had been not only a foreigner by birth, but a shady character in his own right, a man who kept on believing in the things for which Granpa Hodgins fought after they were proved wrong. I don't know how I learned that Grandfather Backmaker had made speeches advocating equal rights for Negroes or protesting the mass lynchings so popular in the North, in contrast to the humane treatment accorded these noncitizens in the Confederacy. Nor do I remember where I heard he had been run out of several places before finally settling in Wappinger Falls or that all his life people had muttered darkly at his back, "Dirty Abolitionist!"--a very deep imprecation indeed. I only know that as a consequence of this taint my father, a meek, hardworking, worried little man, was completely dominated by my mother who never let him forget that a Hodgins or a McCormick was worth dozens of Backmakers.<br> <br>I must have been a sore trial to her for I showed no sign of proper Hodgins gumption, such as she displayed herself and which surely kept us all--though precariously--free. For one thing I was remarkably unhandy and awkward, of little use in the hundred necessary chores around our dilapidated house. I could not pick up a hammer at her command to do something about fixing the loose weatherboards on the east side without mashing my thumb or splitting the aged, unpainted wood. I could not hoe the kitchen garden without damaging precious vegetables and leaving weeds intact. I could shovel snow in the winter at a tremendous rate for I was strong and had endurance, but work requiring manual dexterity baffled me. I fumbled in harnessing Bessie, our mare, or hitching her to the cart for my father's trips to Poughkeepsie, and as for helping him on the farm or in his smithy, I'm afraid my efforts drove that mild man nearest to a temper he ever came. He would lay the reins on the plowhorse's back or his hammer down on the anvil and say mournfully:<br> <br>"Better see if you can help your mother, Hodge. You're only in my way here."<br> <br>On only one score did I come near pleasing Mother: I learned to read and write early, and exhibited some proficiency. But even here there was a flaw; she looked upon literacy as something which distinguished Hodginses and McCormicks from the ruck who had to make their mark, as an accomplishment which might somehow and unspecifically lead away from poverty. I found reading an end in itself, which probably reminded her of my father's laxity or Grandfather Backmaker's subversion.<br> <br>"Make something of yourself, Hodge," she admonished me often. "You can't change the world"--an obvious allusion to Grandfather Backmaker--"but you can do something with it as it is if you try hard enough. There's always some way out."<br> <br>Yet she did not approve of the post-office lottery, on which so many pinned their hopes of escape from poverty or indenture. In this she and my father were agreed; both believed in hard work rather than chance.<br>Still, chance could help even the steadiest toiler. I remember the time a minibile--one of the small, trackless locomotives--broke down not a quarter of a mile from Father's smithy. This was a golden, unparalleled, unbelievable opportunity. Minibiles, like any other luxury...</p><h2>The Ice at the Bottom of the World</h2><p>In these ten stories, Mark Richard, winner of the 1990 PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award, emerges as the heir apparent to Mark Twain, Flannery O'Connor, and William Faulkner.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>In these ten stories, Mark Richard, winner of the 1990 PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award, emerges as the heir apparent to Mark Twain, Flannery O&#39;Connor, and William Faulkner.stories, Mark Richard, winner of the 1990 PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award, emerges as the heir apparent to Mark Twain, Flannery O&#39;Connor, and William Faulkner.</p><h2>Watson Drawing Book</h2><p>This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.

Hooking readers quickly with an alluring glimpse of ancient grave robbers moving "with catlike stealth" in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, Frank sets the scene and then fast-forwards 30 centuries to the efforts of ambitious archeologist Howard Carter and his wealthy friend and financial backer Lord Carnarvon. The author's sophisticated blend of alliteration ("the seas of sweat his pores had spilled") and vivid imagery ("evening shed its twilight husk"; a curse "as dangerous as a sharpened sword"; an afterlife "born again from death's dark womb") conjures all the awe and excitement of Carter's prolonged search and triumphant discovery. An equally intriguing afterword tells more about Tutankhamen, as well as his legendary curse and the mysterious death of Carnarvon. Pohrt's (Having a Wonderful Time) graceful watercolors with their careful composition and muted sepia tones recall old photographs, while borders filled with hieroglyphs and Egyptian motifs underscore the exotic setting.

Much later, 1987-1993, she lived in Vietnamese villages, including a former Viet Cong base where women played a prominent role during the war. Her beautifully modulated memoir is less about the war itself than about the unique character of the village women: their formalized social interaction, use of traditional medicine, food-gathering and preparation and the Buddhist beliefs that guide their behavior. Borton's gently compelling narrative follows the rhythm of the seasons and weather patterns and records the jarring advent of Western-style consumerism with the appearance of jeans, tennis shoes, motorcycles and VCRs. Describing her life in Hanoi ("Vietnam's largest village"), where in 1990 she opened a Quaker Service office, she conveys her great affection for its hurly-burly pace. The author conversed with Vietnamese women fluently in their own language and thus is able to present fuller portraits than could be found elsewhere in English.

Moser follows up her inspirational Mustard Seed series of novels by exploring the timely topic of random chance versus divine will. In a few seconds, Sun Fun Airlines Flight 1382 goes from takeoff to nightmare, as the plane crashes into a heavily trafficked bridge, then plunges into a frigid river. Ninety-seven people are dead, and five passengers are left to wonder why they are alive. The survivors, three women and two men, re-examine their priorities and ideas about God, while journalist Dora Roberts struggles with the temptation to indulge in sensationalist exploitation of the disaster as she covers the aftermath for the Chronicle. Despite writing from multiple points of view, Moser keeps the story line clear and the pacing steady. However, like many recent Christian fiction releases, the novel is too long; it also includes a seven-page dialogue between Tina and another character that mostly functions to present the plan for salvation. Readers will have to stretch their imaginations to believe that the characters share as much personal information as they do with their seatmates in the long delay before takeoff. However, Moser makes the stretch worth the effort. As the survivors mull over why they were spared, Moser admirably demonstrates that tragedy is a life-changing opportunity, in which reassessments and changes for the better are possible. This is upbeat news that many Christian readers will appreciate after recent tragic events. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Mindgames: Phil Jackson&#39;s Long, Strange Journey</h2><p>Chronicles Jackson&#39;s rise to prominence as a coach of professional basketball teams including the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers, and explores his ability to successfully counsel, teach, and lead his players.</p><p>Complex as he is colorful, Phil Jackson has led an improbable basketball life, marching to the tune of his own iconoclastic drummer and managing to win at every level along the way. He doesn't think like an average jock, nor does he approach his game like one: just ask Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, who've played better for him than for anyone else. Roland Lazenby couldn't have come up with a better title for his compelling exploration of what makes Jackson tick and how he evolved into one of the most successful and driven coaches in NBA history; for Jackson, the joy of his game is every bit as cerebral and psychological as it is physical. His aim, he says, is to help his players "strengthen the muscle of their minds."<p> Of course, Jackson--part shaman, part shrink, part mentor, part guide--has found some fascinating ways to strengthen his own, including LSD, meditation, Zen, Native American culture, William James's <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, and the Grateful Dead. They are as much a part of Jackson's evolving core as pounding the offensive boards with the Knicks and warring with Bulls' management. If some of it seems contradictory, it is those very contradictions--more than the seven championship rings as a coach and two as a player--that make Jackson so interesting; they have helped him reshape and redefine the job. "Somehow," writes Lazenby, "Jackson has managed the very difficult feat of blending fun and discipline and spiritual exploration for his teams, sort of like combining a trip to the dentist with a carnival ride." No other coach has learned to walk that delicate balance so gracefully. But then, balance is Jackson's operating metaphor: keeping himself--and his teams--in balance while keeping opponents off theirs.</p><p> In <i>Mindgames</i>, Lazenby puts together a smart, solidly reported, and balanced portrait of a Zen master with a dark, driven side. He respects Jackson enough to not whitewash him. After all, innovators have a way of stepping on toes, and in basketball, the shoes, like the personalities, tend to be oversized. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Mindgames is the story of Phil Jackson's remarkable rise to the top of the NBA coaching hierarchy. In it, author Roland Lazenby reveals the fascinating elements of Jackson's life and mental approach to coaching that have made followers of his players but also have made him--perhaps not surprisingly--unpredictable and sometimes unpopular to outsiders. It is also a detailed basketball story, with entertaining accounts from Jackson's years with the New York Knicks under the legendary Red Holzman to the remarkable six championships as coach of the Chicago Bulls and now a seventh title with the Los Angeles Lakers. <p>Born into a Pentecostal family that kept its distance from the secular world, the young Jackson developed deep appreciation for Native American culture and spiritual beliefs, beliefs that would later influence his unorthodox coaching methods. His transformation from naive child to streetwise flower child happened in a matter of months; his immersion in the counterculture of the 1960s and his injury-plagued NBA career would determine the person--and coach--he would become. </p><p>Regarded as a pariah from his playing days, Jackson toiled anonymously as coach of the Continental Basketball Association's Albany Patroons before the Bulls hired him as an assistant coach in 1987 at the unlikely age of forty-one. Assuming the head coaching duties after two seasons, he immediately separated himself from other NBA coaches by heaping pressure on opponents instead of his players. To lessen the anxiety of playing in the white-hot world of the NBA, he brought a thoughtful approach to performance--from meditation to mindfulness to yoga. </p><p>His success lies in his intensely psychological approach to building championship teams--maintaining authority without dictating to his players, building friendships with them without pandering to them, and earning their respect. </p><p>Jackson's approach is not for everyone. His battles with Bulls management spilled over into an ugly display in 1998 in the midst of their last championship run, and his relationships with a few NBA coaches have turned contentious. Yet even those who don't like him marvel at his mastery, at what he can do with a basketball team that no one else can. </p><p>In Mindgames, Lazenby compellingly portrays a man with a unique determination to control the competitive environment he inhabits. A clear picture of the Jackson mystique emerges: philosopher, teacher, manipulator, counselor, psychologist, shaman, champion, master of mind.</p></p><h2>William Lumpkins: Pioneer Abstract Expressionist</h2><p>Brand New.

He also is the author of Clerical Errors and The Bacon Fancier He formerly was a professor of English at Queens College.Memories of past sorrow and misspent passion come unbidden to an elderly Holocaust survivor in this elegant novel, when a woman bearing a resemblance to an old love joins the staff at a retirement home located on Manhattan's Upper West Side. While most of the residents of the Emma Lazarus home are busy squabbling over the casting and the direction of Hamlet, Otto Korner, challenging ghosts of his own, feels appropriately cast as the Gravedigger. A published poet at 19, and unable to serve in the army, he is sent to Zurich by his family at the advent of World War I. There he meets a thoughtful, bookish Lenin, an ``unmannered oaf'' named James Joyce, and is an unhappy midwife at Tristan Tzara's birthing of the Dadaist movement. It is there, too, that he becomes obsessed with the high-spirited, scornful Magda Damrosch, whose likeness he sees 60 years later in the ``dull, empty-headed'' physical therapist from Cleveland. His placid, unreflective life at the retirement home, already shaken, is further disturbed when a prized letter from the poet Rilke, praising his ``precocious talent,'' is stolen. Someone begins sending clues in verse-- ``charades,'' he calls them--and they tax both his literary and personal memory. Isler moves smoothly from war to war and to the present, with Korner moving among memories of his youth; of his two wives (``both...were cremated, only one of them by her own request''); of his emigration in 1947 to New York, where he found his sister hanged in her kitchen (``I stuffed Lola's memory high on the closet shelf with the rest of my past and closed the door tightly''); and of his quiet, uneventful years at the New York Public Library where, ironically, he was placed in charge of materials published in Germany between 1929 and 1945. A delicious, evocative, gentle debut, written in prose to be savored and cherished. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When Ernst Stavro Blofeld murders Bond&#39;s wife the British agent goes to pieces. Before he goes under completely, M is persuaded to give him one last chance and sends him to Japan.</p><p>During World War II Ian Fleming served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, rising to the rank of Commander. His wartime experiences provided him with knowledge of secret operations. After the war, he built his house, Goldeneye, in Jamaica. There, at the age of 42, he wrote Casino Royale, the first of the James Bond novels. By the time of his death in 1964, Fleming&#x2019;s 14 Bond adventures had sold more than 40 million copies and the cult of James Bond was internationally established.&nbsp; <b>1. SCISSORS CUT PAPER</b> <p>The geisha called 'Trembling Leaf, on her knees beside James Bond, leant forward from the waist and kissed him chastely on the right cheek.</p> <p>'That's a cheat,' said Bond severely. 'You agreed that if I won it would be a real kiss on the mouth. At the very least,' he added.</p> <p>'Grey Pearl', the Madame, who had black lacquered teeth, a bizarre affectation, and was so thickly made up that she looked like a character out of a noh play, translated. There was much giggling and cries of encouragement. Trembling Leaf covered her face with her pretty hands as if she were being required to perform some ultimate obscenity. But then the fingers divided and the pert brown eyes examined Bond's mouth, as if taking aim, and her body lanced forward. This time the kiss was full on the lips and it lingered fractionally. In invitation? In promise? Bond remembered that he had been promised a 'pillow geisha'. Technically, this would be a geisha of low caste. She would not be proficient in the traditional arts of her calling - she would not be able to tell humorous stories, sing, paint or compose verses about her patron. But, unlike her cultured sisters, she might agree to perform more robust services - discreetly, of course, in conditions of the utmost privacy and at a high price. But, to the boorish, brutalised tastes of a gaijin, a foreigner, this made more sense than having a tanks of thirty-one syllables, which in any case he couldn't understand, equate, in exquisite ideograms, his charms with budding chrysanthemums on the slopes of Mount Fuji.</p> <p>The applause which greeted this unbridled exhibition of lasciviousness died quickly and respectfully. The powerful, chunky man in the black Jukata, sitting directly across the low red lacquer table from Bond, had taken the Dunhill filter holder from between his golden teeth and had laid it beside his ashtray. 'Bondo-san,' said Tiger Tanaka, Head of the Japanese Secret Service, 'I will now challenge you to this ridiculous game, and I promise you in advance that you will not win.' The big, creased brown face that Bond had come to know so well in the past month split expansively. The wide smile closed the almond eyes to slits - slits that glittered. Bond knew that smile. It wasn't a smile. It was a mask with a golden hole in it.</p> <p>Bond laughed. 'All right, Tiger. But first, more saks! And not in these ridiculous thimbles. I've drunk five flasks of the stuff and its effect is about the same as one double Martini. I shall need another double Martini if I am to go on demonstrating the superiority of Western instinct over the wiles of the Orient, Is there each a thing as a lowly glass tumbler discarded in some corner behind the cabinets of Ming?'</p> <p>'Bondo-san. Ming is Chinese. Your knowledge of porcelain is as meagre as your drinking habits are gross. Moreover, it is unwise to underestimate saks. We have a saying, "It is the man who drinks the first flask of saks then the second flask drinks the first; then it is the saks that drinks the man.'" Tiger Tanaka turned to Grey Pearl and there followed a laughing conversation which Bond interpreted as jokes at the expense of this uncouth Westerner and his monstrous appetites. At a word from the Madame, Trembling Leaf bowed low and scurried out of the room. Tiger turned to Bond. 'You have gained much face, Bondo-san. It is only the sums wrestlers who drink saks in these quantities without showing it. She says you are undoubtedly an eight-flask man.' Tiger's face became sly. 'But she also suggests that you will not make much of a companion for Trembling Leaf at the end of the evening.'</p> <p>'Tell her that I am more interested in her own more mature charms. She will certainly possess talents in the art of love making which will overcome any temporary lassitude on my part.' This leaden gallantry got what it deserved. There came a spirited crackle of Japanese from Grey Pearl. Tiger translated. 'Bondo-san this is a woman of some wit. She has made a joke. She says she is already respectably married to one bonsan and there is no room on her futon for another. Bansan means a priest, a greybeard. Futon, as you know, is a bed. She has made a joke on your name.'</p> <p>The geisha party had been going on for two hours, and Bond's jaws were aching with the unending smiles and polite repartee. Far from being entertained by the geisha, or bewitched by the inscrutable discords issuing from the catskin-covered box of the three-stringed samisen, Bond had found himself having to try desperately to make the party go. He also knew that Tiger Tanaka had been observing his effort with a sadistic pleasure. Dikko Henderson had warned him that geisha parties were more or less the equivalent, for a foreigner, of trying to entertain a lot of unknown children in a nursery with a strict governess, the Madame, looking on. But Dikko had also warned him that he was being done a great honour by Tiger Tanaka, that the party would cost Tiger a small fortune, whether from secret funds or from his own pocket, and that Bond had better put a good face on the whole thing since this looked like being a breakthrough in Bond's mission. But it could equally well be disaster.</p> <p>So now Bond smiled and clapped his hands in admiration. He said to Tiger, 'Tell the old bitch she's a clever old bitch,' accepted the brimming tumbler of hot saks from the apparently adoring hands of Trembling Leaf, and downed it in two tremendous gulps. He repeated the performance so that more saks had to be fetched from the kitchen, then he placed his fist decisively on the red lacquer table and said with mock belligerence, 'All right. Tiger! Go to it!'</p> <p>It was the old game of Scissors cut Paper, Paper wraps Stone, Stone blunts Scissors, that is played by children all over the world. The fist is the Stone, two out-stretched fingers are the Scissors, and a flat hand is the Paper. The closed fist is hammered twice in the air simultaneously by the two opponents and, at the third downward stroke, the chosen emblem is revealed. The game consists of guessing which emblem the opponent will choose, and of you yourself choosing one that will defeat him. Best of three goes or more. It is a game of bluff.</p> <p>Tiger Tanaka rested his fist on the table opposite Bond. The two men looked carefully into each other's eyes. There was dead silence in the box-like little lath-and-paper room, and the soft gurgling of the tiny brook in the ornamental square of garden outside the opened partition could be heard clearly for the first time that evening. Perhaps it was this silence, after all the talk and giggling, or perhaps it was the deep seriousness and purpose that was suddenly evident in Tiger Tanaka's formidable, cruel, samurai face, but Bond's skin momentarily crawled. For some reason this had become more than a children's game. Tiger had promised he would beat Bond. To fail would be to lose much face. How much? Enough to breach a friendship that had become oddly real between the two of them over the past weeks? This was one of the most powerful men in Japan. To be defeated by a miserable gaijin in front of the two women might be a matter of great moment to this man. The defeat might leak out through the women. In the West, such a trifle would be farcically insignificant, like a cabinet minister losing a game of backgammon at Blades. But in the East? In a very short while, Dikko Henderson had taught Bond total respect for Oriental conventions, however old-fashioned or seemingly trivial, but Bond was still at sea in their gradations. This was a case in point. Should Bond try and win at this baby game of bluff and double-bluff, or should he try to lose? But to try and lose involved the same cleverness at correctly guessing the other man's symbols in advance. It was just as difficult to lose on purpose as to win. And anyway did it really matter? Unfortunately, on the curious assignment in which James Bond was involved, he had a nasty feeling that even this idiotic little gambit had significance towards success or failure.</p> <p>As if with second sight. Tiger Tanaka spelled the problem out. He gave a harsh, taut laugh that was more of a shout than an expression of humour or pleasure. 'Bondo-san, with us, and certainly at a party at which I am the host and you are the honoured guest, it would be good manners for me to let you win this game that we are to play together. It would be more. It would be required behaviour. So I must ask your forgiveness in advance for defeating you.'</p> <p>Bond smiled cheerfully. 'My dear Tiger, there is no point in playing a game unless you try to win. It would be a very great insult to me if you endeavoured to play to lose. But if I may say so, your remarks are highly provocative. They are like the taunts of the sumo wrestlers before the bout. If I was not myself so certain of winning, I would point out that you spoke in English. Please tell our dainty and distinguished audience that I propose to rub your honourable nose in the dirt at this despicable game and thus display not only the superiority of Great Britain, and particularly Scotland, over Japan, but also the superiority of our Queen over your Emperor.' Bond, encouraged perhaps by the crafty ambush of the sake, had committed himself. This kind of joking about their different cultures had become a habit between himself and Tiger, who, with a first in PPE at Trinity before the war, prided himself in the demokorasu of his outlook and the liberality and breadth of his understanding of the West. But Bond, having spoken, caught the sudden glitter in the dark eyes, and he thought of Dikko Henderson's cautionary, 'Now listen, you stupid limey bastard. You're doing all right. But don't press your luck. T.T.'s a civilized kind of a chap - as Japs go, that is. But don't overdo it. Take a look at that mug. There's Manchu there, and Tartar. And don't forget the soanso was a Black Belt at judo before he never went up to your bloody Oxford. And don't forget he was spying for Japan when he called himself assistant naval attache in their London Embassy before the war and you s...</p></p><h2>Cloneworld (4) (A Combat K Novel)</h2><p>Bilstering military SF starring a crack-combat team!<br><br>Junks, an evil alien scourge, are flooding Quad-Gal with terror and Combat K are sent on a mission to find an elusive alien retrovirus which can be used against the enemy.

But what we have discovered is that receiving information and advice alone does not lead to transformation and growth. This happens only when a person becomes internally motivated to change. Coaching empowers people to change without telling them what to do. To be empowered means to take ownership of and responsibility for shaping your own future. This is based on the principle that the people you coach will understand, value, and apply for themselves what you help them to discover, not what you tell them. We are also convinced that as churches and faith-based organizations discover the power and possibilities of coaching, there will be a growing effort to rebuild ministries and develop leaders around what we call the Coaching-Based Ministry&#x2122; model. This book is built around helping you find answers to three key questions. � Why coaching? � What is it like to be coached? � What does it take to become an effective coach? It is our hope and prayer that you will find meaningful answers to those questions and will then join us in bringing Coaching-Based Ministry&#x2122; to the churches and faith-based organizations in your area.

Blumenschein: The Life of an American Artist (Volume 28) (The Oklahoma Western Biographies)</h2><p><p>Few who appreciate the visual arts or the American Southwest can behold the masterpieces <i>Sangre de Cristo Mountains </i>or <i>Haystack, Taos Valley, 1927 </i>or <i>Bend in the River, 1941 </i>and come away without a vivid image burned into memory. The creator of these and many other depictions of the Southwest and its people was Ernest L. Blumenschein, cofounder of the famous Taos art colony. This insightful, comprehensive biography examines the character and life experiences that made Blumenschein one of the foremost artists of the twentieth century.</p><p>Robert W. Larson and Carole B. Larson begin their life of &#x201c;Blumy&#x201d; with his Ohio childhood and trace his development as an artist from early study in Cincinnati, New York City, and Paris through his first career as a book and magazine illustrator. Blumenschein and artist Bert&nbsp;G. Phillips discovered the budding art community of Taos, New Mexico, in 1898. In 1915 the two along with Joseph Henry Sharp, E. Irving Couse, and other like-minded artists organized the Taos Society of Artists, famous for preferring American subjects over European themes popular at the time.</p><p>Leaving illustration work behind, Blumenschein sought a distinctive place in his American homeland and in fine-art painting. He moved with his family to Taos in 1919 and began his long career as a figurative and landscape painter, becoming prominent among American artists for his Pueblo Indian figures and stunning southwestern landscapes.</p><p>Robert Larson calls Blumenschein a &#x201c;transformational artist,&#x201d; trained classically but drawing to a limited degree on abstract representation. Placing Blumy&#x2019;s life in the context of World War I, the Great Depression, and other national and world events, the authors show how an artistic genius turned a fascination with the people, light, and color of New Mexico into a body of work of lasting significance to the international art world.</p></p><p><b>Robert W. Larson</b> is retired as Professor of History at the University of Northern Colorado, Greeley.

From the intro: "The history of the West is still largely the story of discovery, exploration, survey, colonization, and the like; for aught else is of comparatively recent development&#x2014;is contemporaneous, or nearly such. The bison was the original engineer, who followed the lay of the land and the run of the water; the Indian followed the bison; the white man followed the Indian; the gun and trap, the pick and shovel, the whiskey-jug, plow, and locomotive followed the white man, at little if any interval: this is the order of empire westward. Every step of this succession is of absorbing interest and momentous consequence; perhaps none more so than those taken during what I may style the picturesque period, when the plain was furrowed not by the plow but by the hoof of the bison, when no Indian war-whoop had been silenced by a steam-whistle, when the trapper and trader were romantic figures in scenes untamed to more prosaic industries. Such times as these call for chroniclers; and it is the purpose of the American Explorer Series, of which the present volumes form a continuation, to traverse this historic ground, perhaps to cultivate some corners of this fruitful field. What results may be expected are instanced in the case of the Journal of Jacob Fowler, with which the series began. Whoever heard of it, or of its author, till this year of grace 1898? A floating paragraph in one or two not well-known books was to the vague effect that a trader named Glenn took a party to Santa Fe in 1822&#x2014;that was all. Now we have the narrative of that enterprise, complete in every detail, in an authentic, genuine, original, contemporaneous human document&#x2014;and of such is the kingdom of history. Few persons now living may measure the full importance of the Fur Trade as a factor in the development of what has been called the " wild and woolly-West "&#x2014;thereby giving occasion for Lummis' witty retort upon a " tame and cottony East." Fewer still can be aware of what iniquities and atrocities the seamy side of that indispensable industry reveals. Those who have read the Journals of Alexander Henry and David Thompson have had their eyes opened to the systematic swindling and debauching of Indians which characterized the traffic as conducted in Canada and some portions of the United States, and may readily believe that the pursuit of pelf in pelt was always tarred with the same stick. This identical subject&#x2014;intrinsically important, in some respects repellent, never failing of tragic interest, albeit sordid and squalid&#x2014;is continued in the autobiography of Charles Larpenteur. As Fowler's Journal and Fowler himself were until this year, so have Larpenteur and his narrative been hitherto&#x2014;unknown. The latter, like the former, will be found composed of the very fiber that goes to the web of history. It is a notable and entirely novel contribution to our knowledge of the Fur Trade of the Upper Missouri for a period of more than an average lifetime, by one who lived the life and worked his way through it, from the position of a mere hand to that of one of its heads. Among other conclusions we may draw from this narrative, it would appear that the unpalliated and unmitigated evils were inherent in the system of traffic itself, red and white natures being what they respectively were; that there was a smoother than the seamy side of the business; that a good, kindly man might be about it, and die poor but honest; and that it called out some of the best as well as the worst of human qualities&#x2014;some of the most manly, even heroic, traits, remote from cupidity and cruelty."</p><p></p><h2>Martin Scorsese: A Journey</h2><p>Traces Scorsese&#39;s life from his days as an altar boy through his ascension to a preeminent position in the filmmaking world</p><p>Kelly's second book on the acclaimed director has the same patchwork quality as her Martin Scorsese: The First Decade (1980- -not reviewed). Billed as an ``oral history,'' it's really a compendium of quotations from Scorsese and his friends, family, and collaborators. Still, despite the limitations of the genre, Kelly manages to elicit some valuable production history and interpretive comments from her many interviewees, who range from Scorsese's ever- loquacious parents to the usually tight-lipped Robert De Niro, with whom Scorsese has created some of the greatest films of our time, from Mean Streets and Taxi Driver through Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Many of the actors who have worked with Scorsese celebrate here his remarkable directorial style, as do the technicians who marvel at his mastery of the form and his meticulous preparation. Others testify to his absolute devotion to the movies, a fervor matched by the religious intensity in many of his films. Kelly, who studied to become a nun, no doubt overworks the priestliness of Scorsese's vocation in her own prose interludes, much as she spends too much time detailing her personal encounters with the director. (Photos by her husband include two of her and Scorsese.) And the platitudes here by studio execs (Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner) are particularly worthless, as are the testimonial-dinner remarks that pass for forewords by Scorsese's director friends Steven Spielberg and Michael Powell. Vague references to personal problems in Scorsese's life remind us how little these interviews tell us about the man. That's exactly the sort of identity crisis this book suffers from--it aspires to critical seriousness but delivers mostly starlust. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reinvented as the agent of innocent curiosity, Adam was central to the project of redefining contemplation as a productive and public labor. It was by identifying with creation&#x2019;s original sovereign, Joanna Picciotto argues, that early modern scientists, poets, and pamphleteers claimed authority as both workers and &#x201c;public persons.&#x201d; </p><p>Tracking an ethos of <i>imitatio Adami</i> across a wide range of disciplines and devotions, Picciotto reveals how practical efforts to restore paradise generated the modern concept of objectivity and a novel understanding of the author as an agent of estranged perception. Finally, she shows how the effort to restore Adam as a working collective transformed the corpus mysticum into a public. Offering new readings of key texts by writers such as Robert Hooke, John Locke, Andrew Marvell, Joseph Addison, and most of all John Milton, <i>Labors of Innocence in Early Modern England</i> advances a new account of the relationship between Protestantism, experimental science, the public sphere, and intellectual labor itself.</p></p><p>Joanna Picciotto is an Associate Professor of English at University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;<i>Labors of Innocence</i> is an outstanding contribution to early modern studies: strikingly original in its rethinking of key issues in intellectual history, rich in its implications for reconsidering major literary texts of the period, and persuasive in its insistence that there is a far more coherent seventeenth century than traditional definitions that split it have insisted. The virtues of the book are legion: its power of argument, clarity, and importance of subject, its honest engagement with scholarship across relevant disciplines, its care and generosity in dealing with the work of others. The work is complex and creative, the scholarship impeccable, the writing a joy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. Paul Hunter, University of Virginia/University of Chicago</b><br><br>&#x201c;Joanna Picciotto's <i>Labors of Innocence in Early Modern England</i> is a splendid study of the origins, development, and eventual decline of the Experimentalist tradition in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century English letters. In tracing out the arc of this intellectual and professional trajectory, Picciotto engages productively with the crucial religious, socio-economic, philosophical, and literary movements associated with the ongoing labors of the "innocent eye."&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eileen Reeves, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Labors of Innocence</i> is itself an example of what it is about: a field of vision awash with insights. The book is spectacular in its reach, searching in its observations, convincing in its arguments, compelling in its conclusions. The penultimate chapter on Milton presents critical exegesis at its loftiest--and its very best. It shows the poet participating fully in the process by which fallen vision is expanded as sight is refined into insight and insight incites action. Professor Picciotto follows Milton in transforming a howling wilderness into a paradise of the imagination. This is the most important contribution to Milton studies in years.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joseph Wittreich, The Graduate Center of the City University of New York</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Labors of Innocence</i> has a breathtaking scope, thoroughly investigating a wide range of historical and cultural contexts--political, religious, medical, agricultural, sexual, and social.

In 1918, when the Barge Canal was completed, travelers saw things on the new canal they had not seen on the Erie: canalized rivers, movable dams, liberal use of concrete, mechanized locks, and barges pulled by tugs or traveling under their own power. No longer were boats pulled by animals walking along a towpath. The larger vessels of the Barge Canal transported a variety of products, but grain and oil made up the bulk of the traffic on the canal in its highest traffic years in the 1950s.

An apparent bizarre suicide in a remote Welsh farm starts them on a new investigation, which is followed by an unusual request from the War Office. And when a Cotswold veterinary surgeon is charged with poisoning his ailing wife, can Pryor&#x2019;s expert evidence save him from the gallows?</p></p><p>Bernard Knight is the author of the Crown John Mysteries series and is a member of The Medieval Murderers. <br>The growing roster of the dead in the Wye Valley of Wales extends a thriving forensic practice by leaps and bounds. Word of mouth has given forensic pathologist Richard Pryor; his partner, former Home Office forensic scientist Angela Bray; and their lab tech Si�n and housekeeper/secretary Moira more than enough to keep them busy. But new cases seem to arrive every day. Richard begins this round by checking out a death at a Welsh farm. It looks as if a mechanic there has been killed when a tractor he was working on slipped off the wooden blocks holding it up. Richard soon discovers that the accidental death is really murder. The man had been strangled, then hanged in a bid to make him appear a suicide, then crushed by the tractor in a final attempt to confuse the evidence. Richard's other big case is more complicated. A Cotswold veterinarian has been accused of murdering his wife, who was close to death from cancer. The case, which will require help from all the regulars, hinges on the amount of potassium found in her eyes. Retired pathologist Knight follows his last Pryor mystery (Where Death Delights, 2010) with another solid effort. Don't expect fireworks, just a character-driven look at the life of forensic scientists in 1950s Britain with a touch of romance. --Kirkus Reviews, March 1, 2011<br><br>Six months after starting their private forensics practice in England's Wye Valley in 1955, pathologist Richard Pryor and forensic biologist Angela Bray (introduced in Where Death Delights, 2010) get three cases well beyond the routine: the apparent suicide of a mechanic found crushed beneath a tractor, the possible mercy killing of a dying cancer patient by her veterinarian husband, and the alleged murder of an army warrant officer by his colleague in a training exercise in the Mideast. Motive abounds in each case. The mechanic's partners wanted him out of their family business, the vet is having an affair, and the soldier was actively disliked. But evidence, collected with expertise and intuition (though without twenty first-century technology), leads to surprising conclusions. Adding spice are personal relationships, notably those between Pryor and Bray, who, somewhat scandalously for the times, share his home as well as workplace, and between Pryor and Moira Davison, the young widow who serves as secretary-cum-cook. A final twist promising complications ahead will leave readers waiting for the next installment of this entertaining series. --Booklist, March 15, 2011</p><h2>Thanksgiving Turkey</h2><p>A thirteen-year-old boy and his mother move to a farm in rural Virginia where he and his grandfather develop a growing bond while trying to hunt a wild tom turkey for their Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>Ronald Himler has illustrated many books for children, including &#34;A Picture Book of Lewis and Clark&#34; by David Adler, and &#34;The Blizzard&#34; by Betty Ren Wright. &#34;School Library Journal&#34; called his art &#34;evocative&#34; and pinpoints a &#34;nostalgic appeal&#34; that Himler &#34;capture[s] so perfectly in...pictures.&#34; He lives in Arizona.K-Gr 6-In this picture book, a 13-year-old and his mother move to his grandfather's farm in rural Virginia. Reluctant at first, the boy adapts to country life, finding there is much to learn from his granddad. Determined to track and shoot an old tom turkey that had been a worthy adversary for years, the grandfather takes the boy hunting. The seasons pass and they are never able to spot the bird, just hear him. One fateful day at Thanksgiving time, they corner the old turkey with his long beard, only to discover the joy in letting him fly free. After all, he had been in the woods as long as the old man and deserved their respect. Soft, watercolor illustrations and a story gently and respectfully told in the first person evoke memories of a time past (when a hard-earned dollar and eighty cents bought a fat turkey). It is a tale well told, reminiscent of sitting and listening to the old folks swap stories at a family gathering.<p></p><p><i>Pamela K.

Cherry-Garrard's <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i> is a gripping account of an expedition gone disastrously wrong. The youngest member of Scott's team, the author was later part of the rescue party that eventually found the frozen bodies of Scott and three men who had accompanied Scott on the final push to the Pole. These deaths would haunt Cherry-Garrard for the rest of his life as he questioned the decisions he had made and the actions he had taken in the days leading up to the Polar Party's demise. <p>Prior to this sad denouement, Cherry-Garrard's account is filled with details of scientific discovery and anecdotes of human resilience in a harsh environment. Each participant in the Scott expedition is brought fully to life. Cherry-Garrard's recollections are supported by diary excerpts and accounts from other teammates. Despite the sad fate of Scott, the reader will grudgingly agree with the closing words of <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i>: "Exploration is the physical expression of the Intellectual Passion. And I tell you, if you have the desire for knowledge and the power to give it physical expression, go out and explore.... If you march your Winter Journeys you will have your reward, so long as all you want is a penguin's egg."</p>"Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time that has ever been devised" wrote Apsley Cherry-Garrard in a deceptively jaunty introduction to this classic story of bravery and fortitude first published in 1922. The story he relates is of Scott's last expedition to the Antarctic. From its departure from England in 1910 to its arrival in New Zealand in 1913, it is one of the most famous and tragic in the annals of exploration. Driven by an obsession for scientific knowledge, these brave polar explorers embarked on a journey into the unknown, testing their endurance by pushing themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they surveyed the striking and mammoth land that lay far to the south.<br>Cherry-Garrard was himself a member of the expedition that had two goals: to discover as much as was scientifically possible about the terrain and habitat of Antarctica, and to be the first to reach the South Pole. The party was plagued by bad luck, weather conditions of unanticipated ferocity, and the physical deterioration of the party on the last part of the journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole a month before them, Scott's party then had to negotiate the last, heroic part of their journey, a doomed attempt which has entered modern mythology.<br>The Worst Journey in the World is the inside story of this most famous of journeys and is truly one of the best and most moving books of travel ever written. Join Scott's expedition as he and his team venture deep into the frozen unknown.

Portland, Or.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War</h2><p><i>Afflicted Powers</i> is an account of world politics since September 11, 2001. It aims to confront the perplexing doubleness of the present&#x2019;s lethal mixture of atavism and new-fangledness. The world careers backward into forms of ideological and geo-political combat that call to mind the Scramble for Africa, and the Wars of Religion. But this brute return of the past is accompanied by an equally monstrous political deployment of (and entrapment in) the apparatus of a hyper-modern production of appearances. Capital is on the move again. In the Middle East and elsewhere it is attempting, nakedly, a new round of primitive accumulation and enclosure.<br><br>Now, however, it is obliged to do so in unprecedented circumstances. Never before has imperialist victory or defeat depended so much on a struggle for hegemony in the world of images; never before has the dominant world power been subject to real catastrophe in the realm of the spectacle. The present turn to empire and enclosure, what Retort terms military neo-liberalism, is confronted not only by various forms of radical Islam but by a new kind of vanguard armed with the toolkit of spectacular politics. This book attempts to rethink certain key aspects of the current global struggle within this overall perspective, and to provide some critical support for present and future oppositions. Its main themes are the spectacle and September 11, blood for oil, permanent war and illusory peace, the US&#x2013;Israel relationship, revolutionary Islam, and modernity and terror.</p><p><b>Retort</b> is a gathering of antagonists to capital and empire, based for two decades in the San Francisco Bay Area. The present book arises from the group's efforts to confront the current political moment and some of the main forms of resistance to it. Involved in the writing were <b>Iain Boal, T. J. Clark, Joseph Matthews, and Michael Watts.</b>&#x201c;This provocative and wide-ranging inquiry&#x2014;part analysis, part manifesto&#x2014;brings to light a new phase in the historical process of primitive accumulation, a form of bitter class war and social reconstruction now proceeding in the guise of what the authors depict as &#x2018;military neo-liberalism.&#x2019; The conclusions and analysis are brought to bear incisively on central events of the contemporary world, and on how its serious threats can be confronted.&#x201d;&#x2014;Noam Chomsky<br><br>&#x201c;A comprehensive analysis of America&#x2019;s relationship with the world.

"I'm going to grab some water bottles from the fridge, okay?"<br><br>"Okay, Mom." Nine-year-old Sophia turned the water off and started wrapping the hose.<br><br>"Remind me to put some in the fridge out here for later."<br><br>"Put some out here for later," Sophia dutifully said.<br><br>"Haha. Come on in after you finish that, and we'll make some cookies."<br><br>Zoe relished her daughter's grin. One that used to f lash all the time before the kidnapping attempt a month ago. She'd been walking home from school when a car pulled up beside her. The vehicle door had flown open, and hands had reached for Sophia. Zoe had been standing on the porch watching it, horrified at the possibility that the man would manage to get her daughter into the vehicle. She'd raced toward them screaming for Sophia to run. Sophia had, and the car had squealed away.<br><br>Zoe shuddered.<br><br>Then the attempt to run Zoe off the road and leave her in the ditch&#x2014;or worse, have her go over the side of the cliff...<br><br>She shook her head.<br><br>At least now they were safe until she could figure out whom to trust and ask for help. Running two hundred miles away from Knoxville, Tennessee, to this little town in the middle of nowhere had seemed like a good idea a few weeks ago. Now she wasn't sure.<br><br>Oh, the people in town were friendly enough, but she and Sophia were so isolated out here. More isolated than she'd intended or understood it to be when she'd taken the job. She drew in a deep breath. But it served its purpose. "Stop it. Get the water and put your worries behind you. You have a painting to finish," Zoe told herself. She was extremely grateful she could work from anywhere. Her paintings sold well in a variety of shops all over the country, providing a good living for her and Sophia. She looked over the area. If she could live anywhere on a permanent basis, it would be somewhere like this. A rich land with horses to ride and plenty of fresh air to breathe.<br><br>"Hey, Mom?"<br><br>She turned back to Sophia. "Yes?"<br><br>"When is Lily going to have her baby?"<br><br>Lily, the pregnant heifer. "Any day now."<br><br>"Is Doctor Aaron going to come check on her today?"<br><br>At the mention of the hunky veterinarian, Zoe's heart turned a flip. "Yes, he'll be here soon, I imagine."<br><br>"I like him." Sophia skipped back to the hose to finish wrapping it.<br><br><i>Yeah, I do, too.</i> She'd run into him at the local diner when he'd walked in with a service animal he had been training. Sophia had been instantly captivated by both man and beast. Zoe hadn't been far behind. When she realized he was the vet who would be checking on Lily on a daily basis, she'd ordered her heart to chill. To no avail. It still did a little happy dance every time he showed up.<br><br>She walked up the porch steps and reached for the knob of the door. Only to stop and snatch her hand away.<br><br>The door wasn't shut all the way. The black crack from top to bottom mocked her. She stepped back, her pulse ratcheting up several notches.<br><br>She knew she'd shut the door. With the indoor cat, who liked to make her escape whenever the opportunity presented itself, Zoe was extra careful with the doors. So why was it open? Had Sophia&#x2014;<br><br>"Mom!"<br><br>Sophia's harsh scream spun Zoe around. Her fear spiking, she froze and stumbled a full turn. A large man held Sophia by her ponytail, a gun pointed to her head. Her daughter cried out again and tried to pull away, but he held her easily.<br><br>"Let her go!" Zoe moved toward them, her only thought to get her child away from the man.<br><br>He moved the weapon so it pointed at Zoe, his finger tightening on the trigger. A cruel smile tilted his thin lips upward. "Bye-bye."<br><br>Zoe shook, somehow made her legs work and ducked behind the wheelbarrow just as a loud crack splintered the air. Sophia screamed, a high-pitched, ear-piercing wail full of terror. Zoe's legs gave out and she hit the ground hard. She tried to think, but the horror sweeping over her wouldn't let her. She had to get to Sophia. She had to get her child back.<br><br>"Stop, you moron! Don't shoot her!"<br><br>Zoe's breath came in pants, her terror lessening a fraction as relief filled her. Someone had come. She nearly sobbed. She forced her legs to stand, to take a step toward the man who still held a crying Sophia. He kept the gun held on Zoe, but glanced at the other man who'd stepped from inside the house, cell phone pressed to his ear. "Don't shoot her!"<br><br>Relief fled and fear gripped her again. What was this second man doing in her house? She headed to Sophia who continued to struggle in spite of the pain inflicted by the man's hold on her hair. With his other hand, he aimed the weapon at Zoe, but didn't pull the trigger, his gaze still darting between her and the man behind her. When she was two steps from Sophia, her daughter's eyes widened and her attention focused behind her. Zoe turned to look over her shoulder, saw a flash of movement. Before she had time to think, something crashed into the side of her forehead, pain exploded through her skull and she fell to the ground.<br><br>Aaron Starke stepped up to the counter and took the two prescription bags from Lucille Andrews, the pharmacist for the Wrangler's Corner Pharmacy. "Thanks."<br><br>"No problem. Hope your mom feels better fast."<br><br>"It's just an ear infection. She should be fine in a day or so."<br><br>"And thanks for taking that out to Zoe. I know she'll appreciate it."<br><br>"Happy to do it. See you later." He headed back to his truck and tossed the bags onto the passenger seat.<br><br>One for his mother and one for the pretty single mom he couldn't seem to get out of his head. Although he really needed to.<br><br>Well, he was going out to the farm anyway to check on the pregnant heifer. Taking the prescription was only being neighborly, nothing else. Right? Right.<br><br>Ten minutes later, he turned into the Updikes' drive and followed it up to the main house. A large four-bedroom home, it looked lived-in and loved, with Thanksgiving decorations hung on the door and a small flag with the words "Thankful for Blessings" stuck in the ground. He figured that was Zoe's doing. He didn't remember Martha Updike bothering with that kind of thing.<br><br>Aaron coasted to a stop at the top of the drive. An old pickup truck sat in front of him. He'd never seen it before and knew Zoe didn't drive it. She had a Jeep Wrangler. Maybe she had family visiting? Then he noticed the open barn door and frowned. Why would Zoe have the door open when the temperatures were already dropping and were supposed to hit record colds tonight?<br><br>He climbed out of the truck and pulled his heavy down coat tighter against his throat. He shoved his hands into his gloves and settled his hat more firmly on his head. Snowflakes drifted down littering the ground that was already starting to turn white. Aaron tromped across the few remaining dried twigs that would be green grass come springtime and knocked on the door. "Zoe? You in there? Sophia? It's Aaron Starke."<br><br>He peered inside and all the animals looked well taken care of with fresh water in their buckets and clean stalls. Aaron walked down to the office and unlocked it. He placed Sophia's medication on the desk, left the office and locked it behind him.<br><br>His next stop was to check on Lily the pregnant cow. She'd been brought in out of the cold and now stood in one of the horse stalls looking fat and ready to get the whole thing over with. He checked her and found the calf had turned. "Well, that's good news," he told her and gave her bulging belly a light pat.<br><br>He cleaned up in the large barn sink then decided to check on Zoe. He thought it strange she hadn't come out to at least say hi and ask about the cow. She had all the other times he'd been by. And every time he'd seen her and talked to her, he'd wound up leaving with her on his mind. Where she stayed. Constantly. He'd learned a few things about her. She loved her daughter, she was a very private person&#x2014;and she was worried about something.<br><br>Satisfied that all was well in the barn, he left and shut the door behind him. A frigid wind blasted across his face, and he shivered. He headed to the house, his heavy boots crunching the brown grass that would soon be covered in the snow still coming down.<br><br>A glint from the ground caught his eye, and he stopped. He stooped down to poke into the dirt and snow with a gloved finger and uncovered a silver necklace with a pretty blue charm. He picked it up, and a red liquid substance slid onto his tan glove. He frowned. Lifted his hand and sniffed. The coppery smell of blood reached him. He spied a large footprint in the area next to the where he'd found the necklace. A boot print too large to be Zoe's.<br><br>He looked up, truly concerned for Zoe and Sophia now. He glanced back at the earth and realized the blood wasn't just limited to that one spot. It trailed drop by drop to the front porch. He followed it, saw more blood on the steps. It could be a simple thing. Maybe she cut her hand on one of the tools in the barn or Sophia fell and scraped her knee or...something.<br><br>But the necklace in the dirt bothered him. It hadn't been there long. There was no rust or embedded dirt. And the blood was still fresh.<br><br>If it had been just one thing, he might not have been overly concerned, but the open barn door, the necklace, the trail of blood that had only just begun to dry, her car parked in the covered area but no sign of Zoe or Sophia...the boot print.<br><br>She was here. Somewhere. The blood suggested close by and in trouble. He moved up onto the wraparound porch and saw more drops of red at the base of the door. He tried to see in the window, but the gauzy curtain blocked his view. Aaron walked around the perimeter of the house and saw nothing else amiss.<br><br>He knocked on the door. A scuffling sound came from inside but no one answered. He knocked again. "Zoe? You in there? You okay?"<br><br>Zoe stared up at the man who pointed the weapon at the end of her nose. Her head throbbed, but at least the blood had begun to dry. Fear pounded through her and she couldn't stop shaking. Sophia clung to her and buried her face in Zoe's neck. "Get rid of him," her captor growled. "Now. Or I'll have to shoot him."<br><br>"We don't need any more trouble, Pete," the other one muttered from his position by the window. He held the gun loosely in his left hand. Comfortably. As though he used it on a regular basis.<br><br>"Like I don't know that," Pete said. The angry scowl twisted his face into something from a horror movie. Zoe wanted to close her eyes and shut them all out, but she couldn't. She kept her arms around Sophia's slight frame. Her daughter was so little, so vulnerable.<br><br>"Now, I said." He jabbed the gun at her, and Zoe flinched. She glanced at the door and back at the man who'd intervened and saved her only to hold her and Sophia captive. She rose on shaky legs, stumbled then caught herself. Sophia rose with her, refusing to let go. Zoe's head swam and bile climbed into her throat. She breathed deep and the dizziness settled.<br><br>The man called Pete grabbed Sophia by the arm and jerked her away from Zoe. Sophia cried out. Pete slapped a hand across her mouth. "Make another sound and I'll shoot your mother, you understand?"<br><br>Zoe stood frozen, wanting to smash the man's face in, but knew one wrong move could cause him to hurt her daughter. "It's okay, honey, just sit still for a minute, all right?" she said.<br><br>Sophia's gaze clung to hers, but she gave a small nod. Pete relaxed his grip a fraction, and Sophia didn't move even as silent tears tracked a path down her ashen cheeks.<br><br>"Hey, Zoe? You okay? It's Aaron Starke. I came to check on Lily and wanted to say hi." The pounding on the front door resumed, and she walked over to it.<br><br>The man near the window lifted his weapon, an un-needed reminder that he was watching. Zoe closed her eyes and drew in a desperately needed calming breath, praying for strength&#x2014;and some way to convey the fact that she needed help without putting the person at the door in harm's way.<br><br>With one last glance at Sophia, she pulled on every ounce of inner strength, ignored the throbbing in her head and opened the door. Aaron stood on the front porch. His large frame filled the doorway, blocking the icy wind and the sunlight. He had to be half a foot taller than her own five foot eight. She forced a trembling smile to her lips. "Hi."<br><br>He offered a frown in response. "I came by to check on that pregnant heifer and saw some blood on the ground and a necklace. This yours?" He held it out to her as his gaze landed on her right temple.<br><br>"Um. Yes. Thanks." She took it and stuffed it in her front pocket.<br><br>He leaned in to take a closer look. "What happened? That looks like a pretty bad gash."<br><br>She raised a shaky hand to lightly touch the wound. "Oh, that." A laugh slipped out, but it sounded nervous to her ears. Scared. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and her eyes darted away from his only to return a fraction of a second later. "I was...ah...clumsy, tripped over the water hose in the barn and hit the side of the stall. I was just getting ready to clean the wound when you knocked."<br><br>"Why don't I give you a hand? I'm pretty good at that kind of thing. Granted, most of my patients are of the four-legged variety, but the concept is the same." He moved as though to enter and panic filled her.<br><br>She shifted and blocked his entrance. "Really, I'm fine. I can do it."<br><br>He paused, his eyes probing the area behind her. She knew he couldn't see anything but the stairs that led up to the second floor. "Well. Okay. If you're sure." He backed up, his boots clunking on the wooden porch.<br><br><i>No!</i> she wanted to scream. She widened her eyes and cut them to the side window. <i>Don't leave!</i><br><br>But he simply tapped his hat in a gentlemanly gesture and turned to go. Then spun back. Her breath caught. Had he figured out she needed help? Did he know someone stood behind her with a gun? "Oh, by the way," he said, "I was in the pharmacy a little bit ago getting a prescription for my mother and Mrs. Lucille gave me Sophia's medication. I left it on the desk in the office in the barn."<br><br>"Oh, th-thank you. We were getting low."<br><br>"I'll just go get it for you."<br><br>"No, no, that's okay, I can get it. I'm going to have to go out there and...ah...fill the water buckets anyway."<br><br>He tilted his head and gave a slow nod. "All right then. Holler if you need anything."<br><br>She nodded but couldn't force any more words out of her tight, tear-filled throat. This time when he turned around, he didn't look back. She shut the door with a soft snick and turned to find the two men staring at her.<br><br>Pete let go of Sophia and she rushed at Zoe, wrapping her arms around her waist and holding tight. Zoe met Pete's gaze since he seemed to be the one in charge. "Now what?" she whispered. "What do you want?"<br><br>His eyes dropped to Sophia. "Her."</p><h2>rainbow magic fairy tale fairies set of 7 paperback books by daisy meadows</h2><p>Once upon a time, Rachel and Kirsty were excited to attend the special Fairy Tale Festival at TipTop Castle.

The problem &#x2013; I kept thinking to myself, <i>I can write a better novel than this</i>. It was approximately a year later, now out of the Marine Corps, that I finally put digital ink to virtual paper, putting my money where my mind was after a year of talking and obsessing about it. It was really that simple &#x2013; I had a vision, made a decision, and put it into action. Once I started, I couldn&#x2019;t stop. Considering how fortunate I am to be in this position today, it was definitely the right choice. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: What was it like writing your first novel? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> An emotionally brutal roller coaster. From the very first rough draft &#x2013; which you saw and gave me great and harsh feedback on &#x2013; to getting an agent, to receiving a book deal with Emily Bestler Books at Atria, it was nothing short of a series of highs and lows, with near deals, constant rejections, and a nomad-like journey wandering in the publishing wilderness, wondering if it would ever happen. I would tell anyone who wishes to become an author that no matter what, you have to have the thickest skin possible and get used to rejection. I remember reading that you have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting a book published with a major publisher as an unknown author. But based on initial beta reader feedback, I persevered because I believed I had a product people would want to read. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: What authors influenced you the most? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> Easy &#x2013; Matthew Reilly. I read <i>Ice Station</i> when I was a junior officer in the Marine Corps in 2000. His pacing, the intimacy of the action &#x2013; especially in his first novel &#x2013; and the scope of his settings were original, making it nearly impossible to put Ice Station down&#x2013; or any of his books, for that matter. For me, it&#x2019;s what the genre should be. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: How much of Overwatch stems from your own personal experiences in the Marine Corps? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> We have a saying &#x2013; &#x201c;You can take the man out of the Marine Corps, but you can never take the Marine Corps out of the man.&#x201d; Like my main character, Logan West, I am a former Marine officer, and all-too-briefly commanded a scout sniper platoon as a young and inexperienced lieutenant. I&#x2019;m also a recovering alcoholic, as well as extremely sarcastic. (You have to have a sense of humor in today&#x2019;s age.) However, while I had a significant amount of tactical training as a junior officer, my deployments were in a staff support function. (Unfortunately, incoming rockets and mortars don&#x2019;t care about your exact function.) The locations, settings, military units, and certain narrative components are all very real, but the overall story is completely my own. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: How likely is something like this to happen? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong>The world is a much darker and more dangerous place than it was when I was getting out of the Marine Corps in 2009. These are strange times. So to answer your question &#x2013; anything is possible. Less global stability creates more opportunities for bad guys of all backgrounds to wreak havoc, both here and abroad. Still, while I wanted to create a realistic setting and origin story for Logan West and friends, my universe is definitely distinct from reality in that my version of our leaders will always make the hard, right decisions when needed. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reich: What are your plans for the future of Logan West? </strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Betley: </strong> When I started writing Overwatch, I had plans for three Logan West Thrillers. My intent was for each novel to be a self-contained story inside a larger story arc. I&#x2019;ve actually just finished First Shot - book two of the series out in 2017 - which takes the overarching plot much further down the proverbial tracks. I&#x2019;m about to start writing book three, which is outlined in my head, and I know where book four &#x2013; and possibly five &#x2013; is going. Beyond that, if the readers will have me, I&#x2019;ll continue to write. In the end, it&#x2019;s all about them. </p>Matthew Betley is a former Marine officer of ten years.

We all like to think we can read a novel and understand what &#39;genre&#39;, &#39;style&#39; and &#39;narrative&#39; mean, but do we really understand them fully and how they can enrich our reading experience? How should we approach the works of great writers such as William Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, Charles Dickens and Jane Austen? And what can we hope to learn from apparently difficult ideas such as &#39;hermeneutics&#39;, &#39;affective fallacy&#39; and &#39;bricolage&#39;? 50 Literature Ideas you Really Need to Know is the essential guide to all the important forms, concepts, themes and movements in literature. It provides a clear, opinionated and thorough overview of theories about the nature of language and meaning, and outlines the thinking behind key literary concepts such as postmodernism, semiology, postcolonialism and structuralism.

In 1944, when we were still in eighth grade, Schloime enjoyed a brief celebrity after his photo appeared on the front page of the Montreal Herald. Following a two-cent rise in the price of chocolate bars, he had been a leader in a demonstration, holding high a placard that read: down with the 7cents chocolate bar. Hashomer Hatza'ir members wore uniforms at their meetings: blue shirts and neckerchiefs. "They had real court martials," wrote Marion Magid in a memoir about her days in Habonim in the Bronx in the early fifties, "group analysis, the girls were not allowed to wear lipstick." Whereas, in my experience, the sweetly scented girls who belonged to Young Judaea favored pearls and cashmere twinsets.

He is the recipient of dozens of literary awards, among them two Governor General's Awards, The Giller Prize and The Commonwealth Writers Prize. He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2001, only several months before his death on July 3rd, 2001.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>In parts memoir, travelogue, political treatise, and extended essay on the tangled question of what it means to be a Jew living outside of Israel. The founders of the state of Israel had hoped that all Jews would come ``home'' after some 2,000 years of exile. Yet 46 years after the birth of the state, less than half the world's Jews live there, and fewer Jews live in Israel than in the United States. Richler (Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!, 1992, etc.) offers no startling new insights into this phenomenon or into the growing split between Israeli Jews and those living in what is called the Diaspora. What he does offer is an intensely personal account of two journeys: one, of a teenager in Montreal who becomes an ardent Zionist in the years leading up to the creation of Israel in 1948; and two, of a Diaspora Jew in his 60s who visits Israel in 1992, measuring the state against his idealistic dreams of decades before, and measuring himself against the Israelis who had once been his teenage comrades in Canada. Making it clear that his sympathies lie with the left, Richler offers a clear picture of the modern state and its highly charged politics, based on numerous interviews and extensive reading. The more interesting parts of the book, however, have to do with Richler's personal engagement with Israel, even as he defends his choice to live in Canada. When a journalist tells Richler that he left the US because in Israel ``I am at home,'' Richler writes, ``But many of us, unapologetically Jewish, do feel at home in North America, the most open of societies.'' It is Richler's passionate, personal wrestling with this issue that sets this book apart from many others on the subject. A provocative and highly readable exploration of Israel in the mind of a Jew who has chosen not to live there, of interest primarily to other Jews aware that they have made the same decision. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Even now, as the editors of this watershed volume attest, a number of our more accomplished poets (mostly of the "pre-Stonewall generation") decline to have their sexual identities made public, or their work associated with gay and lesbian culture. One hopes that their reluctance won't prevent them from reading <i>The World in Us</i> and being dazzled--or shamed--by the daring and eclectic work of these 46 living, midcareer writers who are actively producing queer-themed poetry. With such a wide variety of work included, there's something here for almost everyone, although aficionados of pop culture will be especially pleased, with poems devoted to David Cassidy (Dennis Cooper's "David Cassidy Then"), Marlo Thomas (Jeffrey Conway's "Marlo Thomas in Seven Parts and Epilogue"), and the glamorous Kennedys (Eileen Myles's "An American Poem"). Among the well-established poets here are Marilyn Hacker, David Trinidad, Rafael Campo, and Olga Broumas (represented by a somewhat eccentric selection), while a number of the novices included are young poets involved in the burgeoning spoken-word movement. Each of these writers offers a jolt or a caress, ample evidence of the richness of the poetry scene and the extravagant talents of queer writers. In particular, don't miss the work of Cyrus Cassell, Wayne Koestenbaum (author of <i>The Queen's Throat</i>), or Minnie Bruce Pratt. "We hardly need a place at anyone else's table," the editors note, "when our own dining room is full to bursting." <i>--Regina Marler</i>Michael Lassell is the author of several books as well as the editor of four volumes of prose and verse.

Tozer is a 366-day devotional that dwells on the awesomeness of the Almighty God and His manifest glory. God's awesomeness is often brought out in human speech with the verbal expression of oath taking. Human vocabulary is far too humble and insufficient to properly articulate the words upon being touched by the Spirit of God Almighty. The power of God is awesome, vast and incomprehensible. This 366-day devotional will help to acquaint you with the complexity of God's character and the power of His grace.&nbsp; In order to satisfy your hunger for a genuine encounter with the Creator, Tozer says there must be humility of spirit. He reminds us of our need for humility when he says that Jesus was "bruised and wounded for our iniquities." The penalty paid on the cross was great, and our love for Him should reflect that.&nbsp;Tozer's daily meditations in this book challenge the believer to become more acquainted with the Triune God and His mysterious ways. He inspires the reader to repent to restore the Divine love in our hearts, as well as worship him constantly! Tozer proclaims the mercy of God, saying that God is love who ever does us good!</p></p><p><p><b>Know God as He Is</b><i></i></p><p><i>Tozer on the Almighty God</i> is a 365-day devotional that dwells on the awesomeness of the Almighty God. Tozer was a man who walked closely with God, who prayed often and shunned distraction so he could gaze more purely upon Him. In these daily meditations on Scripture, Tozer urges you to do the same. He will stir you toward humility and full surrender. He will expand your faith in a God so great that words fall short to describe Him. He will nourish you with truth. With each page, may your heart be filled and your worship increased.</p><b>A.W. TOZER</b> began his lifelong pursuit of God at the age of seventeen after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. A self-taught theologian, Tozer was a pastor, writer and editor whose powerful use of words continues to grip the intellect and stir the soul of today's reader.

The traditional image of lace is challenged by these designs, which make exhuberant use of colour and materials.&#39;</p><p>Needle lace, unlike surface embroidery, is attached to a background fabric or frame only at the beginning and end of a piece and around the edges. This frees the embroiderer to create multiple layers, combine other techniques, and use beading and fabric painting as well as a wide variety of types and colors of threads. Nordfors Clarks first book, Needle Lace and Needleweaving: A New Look at Traditional Stitches (1974), remained in print for more than 20 years and is considered a classic introductory text in the field. This new offering expands on the first volume, emphasizing the artistic possibilities of needle lace and including new stitches, innovative techniques (would you believe needle lace embedded in sausage casing?), and a gallery of needle lace from around the world. In one chapter, the author leads the reader step by step through planning a new needle lace piece, including sources of inspiration, design, color, and technique.

Maybe he was feeling a certain way about himself-like most children that age. This book is about instilling confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem in black children and dispelling myths that others may or may not have about black people and their contributions to the world. Through these activities, children and parents will be engaged and will retain more knowledge and will have an enjoyable experience together.</p><p></p><h2>The Color of Earth</h2><p><p>First love is never easy. </p><p>Ehwa grows up helping her widowed mother run the local tavern, watching as their customers &#x2013; both neighbors and strangers &#x2013; look down on her mother for her single lifestyle. Their social status isolates Ehwa and her mother from the rest of the people in their quiet country village. But as she gets older and sees her mother fall in love again, Ehwa slowly begins to open up to the possibility of love in her life.</p><p>In the tradition of <i>My Antonia</i> and <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i>, from the pen of the renowned Korean manwha creator Kim Dong Hwa, comes a trilogy about a girl coming of age, set in the vibrant, beautiful landscape of pastoral Korea.</p></p><p><p>Kim Dong Hwa is the author of many graphic novels &#x2013; or manwha, as they are called in Korea, where he lives. His books include the popular work <i>My Sky</i> and the literary piece <i>The Red Bicycle</i> .</p><p>&#x201c;The first in a trilogy, this beautifully scripted and drawn Korean manhwa provides a truly intimate but respectful journey in the company of a young girl and her widowed mother ... This is an exquisite and feminist-positive story richly literate and imaginative. Readers will eagerly await the subsequent volumes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book has no conflict other than that common to youthful competition over boys, but it is a work of great humanity that sucks the reader in. Kim's artwork is stunning, and seldom has a male writer captured the attitudes, emotions and behavior of female characters so believably.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Flower and water motifs course steadily through the author's erotically tinted observations of daily life, but the breathtakingly elegant line drawings of Korean landscapes elevate the use of such standard metaphors for fertility and sexuality. Furthermore, the author is able to evoke nuances of emotion from stock-character forms in a genre not known for its subtlety.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;The lush drawings combine prettily stylized elements with richly realistic detail, and they turn even indelicate moments, such as a literal pissing contest between local boys, the monk's first nocturnal emissions, and Ehwa's shock at her menarche, into tenderly rendered, universal episodes of growing up. Though the art is black and white, the textures inked in the fabrics and details of the landscapes suggest breathtaking beauty and rich color to complement the lyrical music of the text, which at times becomes poetic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>BCCB</i></p><p>&#x201c;The expressive artwork captures both the beauty of the Korean countryside and the inner life of Ehwa and Namwon. It is a quiet, dreamy book that focuses on characters rather than plot. It should appeal to mature girls ready for a thoughtful coming-of-age story, as well as manga fans looking to try something new.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>VOYA</i></p><p>&#x201c;While the book begins when Ehwa is seven and only takes her into her early teen years, the nostalgic tone and slow pacing make the title more likely to appeal to older readers. The artwork is beautiful, particularly in Hwa's depiction of the landscape and the two main characters. A good additional purchase for libraries looking for less action-oriented manga/manhwa titles.&#x201d; &#x2015;Alana Abbott, James Blackstone Memorial Library, Branford, CT, <i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Color of Earth</i> gives us an intimate glimpse of adulthood seen through the experiences shared by a mother and her child.

However, Asa's considerable skills as a craftsman (he designed and made all these projects) and his eclectic tastes make this a valuable sourcebook for the woodcrafter. The projects range from the simplicity of a basic utility box to the elegance of intricately carved and inlaid bowls. Asa encourages experimentation, drawing design ideas from his extensive travels and his study of other cultures and incorporating bits of found materials, exotic wood remnants, metal forgings, and homemade finishes. The book assumes a fair amount of skill and should not be considered a how-to manual. It works best as an idea book for the experienced woodcrafter looking for something a bit different.

Dunbar's poems offer vivid depictions of late medieval Scottish society and serve up a striking pageant of colorful figures at the court of James IV (r. 1488-1513), with which he was associated for much of his adult life. The poems are remarkable both for their diversity and variability and for their multiplicity of voices, styles, and tones. The great variety of poems within Dunbar's canon includes religious hymns of exaltation, moral poems on a wide range of serious themes, comic and parodic poems of extreme salaciousness and scatological coarseness, general satires against the times, and satires with much more specific targets, often a single individual.<br><br> This edition of eighty-four poems attributed to Dunbar includes extensive background material and explanatory notes that are sure to be of interest to students and Dunbar enthusiasts alike. The edition is rounded out with textual notes, an index of first lines, and a glossary.</p><p>John Conlee is Professor of English at William and Mary.

(Dwight Garner, <i>New York Times</i>)</b><br>Tom Wolfe, whose legend began in journalism, takes us on an eye-opening journey that is sure to arouse widespread debate. THE KINGDOM OF SPEECH is a captivating, paradigm-shifting argument that speech--not evolution--is responsible for humanity's complex societies and achievements.<br><br>From Alfred Russel Wallace, the Englishman who beat Darwin to the theory of natural selection but later renounced it, and through the controversial work of modern-day anthropologist Daniel Everett, who defies the current wisdom that language is hard-wired in humans, Wolfe examines the solemn, long-faced, laugh-out-loud zig-zags of Darwinism, old and Neo, and finds it irrelevant here in the Kingdom of Speech.<br></p><p>Tom Wolfe is the author of more than a dozen books, among them <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, The Right Stuff, The Bonfire of the Vanities, A Man in Full, I Am Charlotte Simmons,</em> and <em>Back to Blood</em>.

His new book, <i>The Kingdom of Speech</i>, is his boldest bit of dueling yet. It's a whooping, joy-filled and hyperbolic raid on, of all things, the theory of evolution....a provocation rather than a dissertation. The sound it makes is that of a lively mind having a very good time, and enjoying the scent of its own cold-brewed napalm in the morning." <br>&#x2015;<b>Dwight Garner</b>, <b><i>New York Times<br></i></b><br><br>"(Wolfe's) trademark rich reporting is unmistakable throughout.... he brings to this academic debate the same irreverence and entertaining quality that lit up <i>Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>....

Which you must read." <br>&#x2015;<b>Don Oldenburg</b>, <b><i>USA Today<br></i></b><br><br>"In this mettlesome, slyly funny takedown, Wolfe spotlights two key scientific rivalries, each pitting a scrappy outsider against the academy....Wolfe's pithy and stirring play-by-play coverage of compelling lives and demanding science transforms our perception of speech....As always, white-suited Wolfe will be all over the media...stirring things up and sending readers to the shelves."&#x2015;<b><i>Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"A fresh look at an old controversy, as a master provocateur suggests that human language renders the theory of evolution more like a fable than scientific fact....Wolfe throws a Molotov cocktail at conventional wisdom in a book that won't settle any argument but is sure to start some."&#x2015;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"In lively, irreverent, and witty prose, Wolfe argues that speech, not evolution, sets humans apart from animals and is responsible for all of humankind's complex achievements....Wolfe's vibrant study manages to be clever, funny, serious, satirical, and instructive."&#x2015;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"With his usual sharp wit and style, Wolfe's return to his roots is a thrilling journey into the who, what, where, when, why, and how of speech that will undoubtedly provoke stimulating conversations." <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Library Journal<br></i></b></p><h2>Michelin Green Guide USA West</h2><p>Explore the vast American West with the updated Michelin Green Guide USA West.

Scripture scholars do not know, making him a fit subject for Michael O'Brien's vivid imagination. In this fictional narrative, Theophilos is the skeptical but beloved adoptive father of St. Luke. Challenged by the startling account of the "Christos" received in the chronicle from his beloved son Luke and concerned for the newly zealous young man's fate, Theophilos, a Greek physician and an agnostic, embarks on a search for Luke to bring him home. He is gravely concerned about the deadly illusions Luke has succumbed to regarding the incredible stories surrounding Jesus of Nazareth, a man of contradictions who has caused so much controversy throughout the Roman Empire. </p><p><br>Thus begins a long journey that will take Theophilos deep into the war between nations and empires, truth and myth, good and evil, and into unexpected dimensions of his very self. His quest takes the reader into four ancient civilizations - the Greek, Roman, Jewish, and that of Christianity at its birth, where he meets those who knew this man that some believe is the Messiah. </p><p><br>Though Theophilos is a man of the past ages, he is as familiar to us as the men of our own times. Schooled in the empiricism of both medicine and philosophy, Theophilos is well suited to speak to our age in which seeing cannot be the basis for faith, but rather hearing the witness of those who have been touched by God and opening ourselves to the possibility of an encounter with the living Christ. This is a story about the mysterious interaction of faith and reason, the psychology of perception, and the power of love over death. </p><p></p></p><p><p><strong>Michael D. O'Brien, </strong>iconographer, painter, and writer, is the popular author of many best-selling novels including <em>Father Elijah</em>, <em>The Father's Tale</em>, <em>Eclipse of the Sun</em>, <em>Sophia House</em>, <em>Theophilos</em>, and <em>Island of the World</em>. His novels have been translated into twelve languages and widely reviewed in both secular and religious media in North America and Europe.</p>"An arresting work. Totally credible both historically and psychologically. There's not a single false note in this music. Do you want to get into a time machine and actually live in the first century world? Then read this book!" ---Peter Kreeft, Professor of Philosophy Boston College<br><br>"O'Brien again takes up the theme of the truth of revelation before an unbelieving generation. This novel searches the soul of our time through the eyes of St. Luke and Theophilos and those they encountered, including the Lord Himself. O'Brien brings to life the wonder that filled the soul of Luke." ---James V. Schall, SJ, Professor of Political Philosophy, Georgetown University<br><br>"All of Michael O'Brien's novels are in a sense 'historical,' even those often regarded as 'prophetic.' <i>Theophilos</i>, set long ago in the first century and meticulously researched, is finely textured, lush and convincing in its depiction of the rich embroglio of Mediterranean culture in the time of the apostles. The epistolary prose is hauntingly provocative, often lyrical, compelling in its characterization of the events reported in Luke and Acts as they might be considered from a learned gentile's point of view. This is a beautiful book." ---David Lyle Jeffrey, Distinguished Professor of Literature and the Humanities, Baylor University</p><h2>Rynosseros</h2><p>Book by Terry Dowling</p><p></p><h2>The Collector&#39;s Guide to Harker Pottery U.S.A.: Identification and Value Guide</h2><p>Briefly traces the history of the Harker Pottery Company, shows a variety of pitchers, creamers, shakers, teapots, and dinnerware, and lists current values</p><p></p><h2>Under Fire</h2><p>When Captain Ken McCoy is asked to leave the Corps after his report on probable North Korean hostilities displeases his superiors, McCoy is hired by the CIA and must join such veterans as Fleming Pickering, Ed Banning, George Hart, Jack Stecker, and others to retaliate against Korea&#39;s invasion of the 38th parellel, in a thrilling novel of adventure set in 1950. 275,000 first printing.</p><p>Having wrapped up World War II with 1999's <i>In Danger's Path</i>, bestselling military author W.E.B.

Back are familiar characters from Griffin's previous Corps books--daredevil pilot Pick Pickering, his Scotch-sipping father, Brigadier General Fleming Pickering, Capt. Ken "Killer" McCoy, and Master Gunner Ernie Zimmerman--with historical figures including President Harry Truman and General Douglas MacArthur making appearances as well. It's now 1950, and with Communist forces making their presence felt below the 38th Parallel, Griffin's plot centers on Gen.

At least two outfits, however, are not impressed by such infighting: the fledgling CIA, which promptly hires McCoy, and the North Koreans, who on June 25th invade across the 38th parallel. Immediately, veterans scattered throughout military and civilian life are called up, many with only 72 hours' notice. Fleming Pickering and his daredevil son Malcolm, Ed Manning, George Hart, Jack Stecker, Jake Dillon, Ernie Zimmerman - for them and their sweethearts and wives, names such as Inchon, Pusan, and the Choisin Reservoir will acquire a new, bloody reality, and Korea will become not only a new battlefield...but their greatest challenge of all.</p><p>Filled with the crackling realism, adventure, and rich characters that are his hallmarks, Under Fire is further proof, as Tom Clancy says, that "W.E.B.

Walks in the local countryside with the dogs and perhaps a meal in the pub are all the excitement she wants. When her arrival at the village coincides with the funeral of local businessman Douglas Callendar found electrocuted in his bath, Thea&#x2019;s interest is piqued. When another villager is discovered brutally murdered the following day, Thea is thrust into the middle of yet another police investigation.</p><p>Rebecca Tope is the author of three bestselling crime series, set in the stunning Cotswolds, Lake District and West Country. She lives on a smallholding in rural Herefordshire, where she enjoys the silence and plants a lot of trees, but also manages to travel the world and enjoy civilisation from time to time. Most of her varied experiences and activities find their way into her books, sooner or later."Terrific entry in this series. One that kept me guessing to the end. No change there. Highly recommended." (Lizzie Hayes <i>Promoting Crime Fiction</i>)</p><h2>Allegra Maud Goldman</h2><p>This comic novel, first published in 1976, about a feisty Jewish girl child growing up in a wealthy bourgeois Brooklyn family in the 1920s is evoked by a conciousness witty, authentic, and memorable. Alone, Allegra must learn about what it means to be female, about sex, and about death. She must reconcile the bigotries and limitations of her difficult family, and give and receive love however she can. There are memorable scenes in school and summer camp, with friends, and with older girls and women. Throughout, the voice of Allegra remains compellingly defiant and lovable--and, as Tillie Olsen says, &#34;braided with laughter.&#34;</p><p>Allegra Maude Goldman is Edith Konecky&#39;s first novel, first published in 1976. She is the author of A Place at the Table (1989) as well as short fiction and poetry."Allegra Maud Goldman. There's a whole plot in that name...I knew from the beginning that I would never fit that name." For Allegra, growing up is challenging on every front. Her father is rarely happy, her mother is rarely home, and her older brother just wants to practice the piano. Grandma stays in the background, except at Passover - then she is in the kitchen. Allegra questions everything, coming up with her own answers to what she sees through her young eyes, and her observations are fun and refreshing. She is the kind of child who drives her parents and teachers crazy: she's not bad, she's not mean, people call her precocious. But as Allegra observes: "...they never said it as though it were anything good to be." When she is forced to take home economics, she remembers her teacher as "a large, jolly-looking woman with a heart of stone." Her friend Melanie wonders about the home economics course: "if they're preparing us to be housewives and mothers, why don't they teach us something really useful like sexual intercourse?" To which Allegra remarks: "That's the kind of girl she was. Brainy." By the end of the novel, through Allegra's laughter and tears, we feel excitement for her future and realize she does indeed fit her name. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Holly Smith</i><br><br>Konecky declared the emancipation of the twentieth-century woman writer... -- <i>Belles Lettres</i><br><br>Many, many readers are going to recognize just what she's going through and share it with pleasure. -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>One of those rare delights, a novel of childhood...that is as wise and true as it is funny... -- <i>Ms. Magazine</i></p><h2>Donna Karan</h2><p>The most prominent and successful designer in American fashion, Donna Karan's popularity is due to her philosophy of designing real clothes for real women, as easily worn in normal life as on the catwalk.

It was a magnificent and meandering road that enticed millions of newly motoring Americans to hop in their Model Ts and explore the fading frontier.

Most every town, restaurant, mom-and-pop store the author encounters along The Main Street Across America has seen better days, but Wallis still takes the time to celebrate their classic architecture and down-home recipes. With an eye for details and a gift for storytelling, he moves just as smoothly between the role of tour guide and yarn spinner as he does between the road's history and its current incarnation. The juxtaposition between old and new is further underlined by the presentation of classic images and new photographs by Williamson. With a chapter dedicated to each of the 13 states that the highway passes through, this book will delight those looking to uncover their local roots as well as adventurers yearning for that American rite of passage&#x2014;a cross-country road trip. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After several skinheads fatally beat Ethiopian immigrant Mulugeta Seraw in Portland, Ore., in 1988, Dees seized the opportunity to expose the hate group he suspected was behind the killers--the White Aryan Resistance (WAR)--as he had done earlier with a Ku Klux Klan-supported murder. Suing WAR and leader Tom Metzger, Dees and colleagues found a WAR lieutenant willing to testify that Metzger encouraged the violence, and thus to support the suit under Oregon laws regarding liability for acts of others. (One skinhead had already pleaded guilty in the criminal case.) The trial had dicey moments, as jurors found the white supremacist charismatic, but Dees's evidence and deft rhetoric won a $12.5 million judgment, now under appeal, against WAR and Metzger for Seraw's family. Although the book is self-serving, the authors responsibly address the free speech concerns the case raised. Photos not seen by PW. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, has pioneered the use of civil suits to attack racist groups, notably in a 1984 suit filed on behalf of a lynching victim's mother, which resulted in the bankrupting of a major Ku Klux Klan organization. (For an account of this suit, see Dees's A Season for Justice , LJ 5/15/91.) In this book, Dees and Fiffer tell the story of a trial in which the racist leaders of White Aryan Resistance were found liable for the 1988 murder by skinheads of an Ethiopian immigrant in Portland, Oregon. The first half of the book, focusing on the pre-trial investigation, contains much annoying hokum, but the authors settle on a more compelling tone as they proceed, offering a revealing glimpse of legal strategies in the details of the trial itself. Still, the story might be more effectively told by an outsider, less certain of the correctness of Dees's methods and more sensitive to legal niceties and controversies.<br><i>- Timothy Christenfeld, Columbia Univ.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Enemy Within</h2><p>NYC chief assistant district attorney Butch Karp faces a difficult case when a serial killer begins stalking the homeless, a situation that is complicated when his daughter volunteers at the shelters where the murders are occurring.</p><p><b>Robert K. Tanenbaum</b> is one of the country's most respected and successful trial lawyers and has never lost a felony case.

Nash, in the driver's seat, had a couple of chili dogs and a can of Pepsi. Next to him, Cooley was eating an Italian hero and drinking a large white coffee. It was early March and chilly, with a persistent rain, and they had left the engine running and turned on the wipers and the defroster. The car was warm, the windows were clear. </p><p> Infrequently, for it was a Sunday night, a car came down the street, slowing to pass the unmarked, and when that happened, both men stopped eating. Nash checked the rearview, and Cooley craned his neck and looked behind him and followed the vehicle as it splashed past. They were looking for a particular car, a van actually, dark blue with white lettering. It belonged to a guy -- whom some other guy had told a third guy about -- who was planning to run in tonight from Virginia with a big load of pistols and automatic rifles to a place on Forty-seventh between Ninth and Tenth. Three other cars were stationed at various places around this part of Manhattan, so that if the guy slipped past the anticrime team that was setting up to make the grab, and ran, there would be cars in position to block the escape. </p><p> Nash stole a glance at his partner, who had not said five words since coming back to the car from the all-night joint with their meal. Cooley's brow was flexed, and his jaw was working rather more than crushing an Italian hero strictly required, indicating a certain tension. Cooley did not like being in a blocking car. No, Detective Cooley preferred to be the first one through the door, pistol out, yelling "Freeze, freeze!" or some other hearty police exclamation. While Willie Nash considered himself as brave as it was necessary for an NYPD detective to be, and while no one had ever accused him of not pulling his load, he freely conceded that his partner was in a different class altogether in the guts department. Not exactly crazy, because Nash, who had a wife and three, would not have worked with a nut, but definitely on the unusual side. At thirty-two, Nash, though four years older than Cooley, operated as the junior partner, which he did not mind, really. It suited his flamboyant personality, and he liked the reflected glory and the lush collars you got when you hung around Cooley. Nash told himself that his part of the deal was watching Brendan's back -- a full-time job in itself -- and keeping something of a lid on the younger man's more outrageous impulses. He wondered now if Cooley was pissed at him for not doing something about the Firmo disaster, that failure being one reason why they were not on point tonight, but really, Nash thought, as he completed his first chili dog, what could he have done? First of all, Cooley had been -- </p><p> "Jesus! That's him. There's that motherfucker!" cried Cooley. Nash looked to his right, startled. A late-model SUV was slipping by, red, an Explorer or a Jeep. </p><p> "Who?" </p><p> "Lomax, who do you think? Let's go!" </p><p> "Cooley, we're supposed to stay here until -- " </p><p> "We'll be right back. Come on! Roll!" Cooley tossed his coffee out the window and the remains of his sandwich down into the footwell. Nash put the car in gear and headed after the SUV, which he now saw was a Cherokee SE with New York plates. </p><p> "Nice car," he observed. "You sure it was Cisco?" </p><p> "I stared the fucker right in the face. Look at him! He's pretending nothing's wrong, just driving along under the limit in a car that's got to be fucking hot as hell. Give him the lights and siren." </p><p> Nash stuck the red flasher on the roof and goosed the siren, a quick moan. The next sound they heard was the scream of spinning tires slipping on wet pavement. The Jeep took off, fishtailing down Forty-seventh Street. Without thinking, Nash tromped on the gas, and the Fury leaped forward, dumping his chili dog and soda all over the front seat. </p><p> The light was red at Eleventh, but it was clear that the Jeep was going to run it, not a big surprise, and Nash did not brake either as they, too, shot through the intersection, drawing an outraged honk from a taxi. The Jeep made a big skidding right at Twelfth and headed uptown, Nash and the Fury on his tail, keeping a couple of lengths back, Nash now trying, through the pumping adrenaline, to take stock of the situation, gain some control. He should tell someone what they were doing. He should call for some backup. This was crazy. It was turning into a high-speed chase, on trail-slick roads; someone was going to get hurt, and not after some armed-bank-robber, mass-murderer type, but an asshole car-thief snitch... </p><p> Thinking thus, he still accelerated, now to ninety miles an hour. At Fifty-third right by the little park, they passed two blue-and-whites parked nose-to-tail for a conversation, and seconds later both of those radio patrol cars joined the pursuit, the radio crackling with demands to know what was going on. Nash did not respond because he was driving too hard. Cooley did not either, although it was his job. The Jeep screamed up onto the Henry Hudson. It suddenly became damply cold in the Fury. Out of the corner of his eye, Nash saw that Cooley had rolled his window all the way down. </p><p> "Closer!" he yelled over the wind blast. </p><p> Nash saw the needle pass a hundred miles an hour, the car shaking like a blender on the scabbed asphalt typical of the city's arterials, bits of chili flying around, his hands locked tight on the shuddering wheel, and then he saw that Cooley had his gun out, and he wanted to yell out something to make Cooley stop, but he had all he could do to keep the Fury from flying off the elevated highway. He should have stopped, he should have taken control, but he didn't, and he could not really have told anyone why, except that every cop in the world would have understood why not. </p><p> Nash brought the unmarked within five yards of the swerving Jeep, and Cooley began to shoot. Nash could hardly hear the flat crack of the shots, the wind filled the car so, and he lost count. He saw the rear window of the Jeep fly to pieces though, and the right rear tire come apart. The rear of the Jeep started to shimmy violently. Cooley was reloading. The Jeep drifted right, struck the guardrails, bounced back, went into a long sideways skid. Nash stepped on his brake and whipped the wheel over hard and felt, sickeningly, his rear tires break loose from the road and felt the tail of his vehicle proceed northward independently of the steering wheel. There was a grinding, metallic thump, a shudder, the scenery revolved, another crash. An enormous boom. The windshield of the Fury starred, buckled. Nash felt sharp things strike his face. </p><p> "Brendan! What the fuck...!" Boom. Cooley was firing through the windshield whenever the red shape of the Cherokee came into sight. Both vehicles were out of control, bouncing across the highway and past each other like dogfighters over blitz-time London. Then a louder crash and the red car disappeared -- no, there it was again for an instant -- another crash, and Nash saw a shower of sparks. After a time, Nash was able to bring the Dodge to a stop. </p><p> "Let's go!" Cooley shouted, and leaped from the car. </p><p> "Cooley! Goddammit! Will you wait?" Cooley did not, but ran into the dark. Nash left the unmarked, too, and found his shaking knees could barely support his weight. Shots, a bunch of them. Now he saw the Cherokee resting sadly on its right wheel rims against the left-side median barrier, with its snout pointed downtown. He saw that Cooley was running toward the stricken car in a combat crouch, firing as he went. Nash pulled out his own pistol and took in the scene. He thought he had time for that because no one seemed to be firing back at him. The unmarked had come to a stop north of the wreck. To the south, one</p></p><h2>Islamization and Native Religion in the Golden Horde: Baba T�kles and Conversion to Islam in Historical and Epic Tradition (Hermeneutics: Studies in the History of Religions)</h2><p><p>This book is the first substantial study of Islamization in any part of Inner Asia from any perspective and the first to emphasize conversion narratives as important sources for understanding the dynamics of Islamization. Challenging the prevailing notions of the nature of Islam in Inner Asia, it explores how conversion to Islam was woven together with indigenous Inner Asian religious values and thereby incorporated as a central and defining element in popular discourse about communal origins and identity. The book traces the many echoes of a single conversion narrative through six centuries, the previously unknown recounting of the dramatic "contest" in which the khan �zbek adopted Islam at the behest of a Sufi saint named Baba T�kles. </p><p>DeWeese provides the English-language translation of this and another text as well as translations and analyses of a wide range of passages from historical sources and epic and folkloric materials. Not only does this study deepen our understanding of the peoples of Central Asia, involved in so much turmoil today, but it also provides a model for other scholars to emulate in looking at the process of Islamization and communal religious conversion in general as it occurred elsewhere in the world.</p></p><p>In 1253, the Franciscan friar William of Rubruck encountered Muslims where he may well not have expected, and certainly did not wish, to find any.<p>Devin DeWeese is Associate Professor of Central Eurasian Studies and Assistant Director of the Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies at Indiana University.</p></p><h2>What You Wear Can Change Your Life</h2><p>Trinny &amp; Susannah have advised and dressed more than 3,000 women.

Baseball is everything: action, grace, the seasons of our lives. George Vecsey&#x2019;s book proves it, without wasting a word.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Lee Eisenberg, author of <i>The Number</i><br><br>In <i>Baseball</i>, one of the great bards of America&#x2019;s Grand Old Game gives a rousing account of the sport, from its pre-Republic roots to the present day. George Vecsey casts a fresh eye on the game, illuminates its foibles and triumphs, and performs a marvelous feat: making a classic story seem refreshingly new. <br><i>Baseball</i> is a narrative of America&#x2019;s can-do spirit, in which stalwart immigrants such as Henry Chadwick could transplant cricket and rounders into the fertile American culture and in which die-hard unionist baseballers such as Charles Comiskey and Connie Mack could eventually become the tightfisted avatars of the game&#x2019;s big-money establishment. It&#x2019;s a celebration of such underdogs as a rag-armed catcher turned owner named Branch Rickey and a sure-handed fielder named Curt Flood, both of whom flourished as true great men of history. But most of all, <i>Baseball </i>is a testament to the unbreakable bond between our nation&#x2019;s pastime and the fans, who&#x2019;ve remained loyal through the fifty-year-long interdict on black athletes, the Black Sox scandal, franchise relocation, and the use of performance-enhancing drugs by some major stars. <br><br>Reverent, playful, and filled with Vecsey&#x2019;s charm, <i>Baseball </i>begs to be read in the span of a rain-delayed doubleheader, and so enjoyable that, like a favorite team&#x2019;s championship run, one hopes it never ends.<br><br>&#x201c;Vecsey possesses a journalist&#x2019;s eye for detail and a historian&#x2019;s feel for the sweep of action. His research is scrupulous and his writing crisp. This book is an instant classic&#x2014;&#x2014; a highly readable guide to America&#x2019;s great enduring pastime.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>The Louisville Courier Journal <br></i></p><p>George Vecsey, a sports columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, has written about such events as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics but considers baseball, the sport he&#x2019;s covered since 1960, his favorite game. He is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>Loretta Lynn: Coal Miner&#x2019;s Daughter</i> (with Loretta Lynn), which was made into an Academy Award&#x2014;winning film. He has also served as a national and religion reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>, interviewing the Dalai Lama, Tony Blair, Billy Graham, and a host of other noteworthy figures. He lives in New York with his wife, an artist.<i>N</i><i>ew York Times</i> sports columnist Vecsey (<i>Year in the Sun</i>) devotes himself to this sprightly history of the national pastime. His survey unfolds much like a highlights tape, with a breezy background narrative of the game from its pre&#x2013;Civil War roots to its current drug scandals, structured around set pieces spotlighting the outsized deeds of luminaries like Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Branch Rickey and George Steinbrenner. He finds plenty of time for color commentary, like an appreciation of radio announcers' whimsical homerun catch-phrases (" 'Get up Aunt Minnie and raise the window!' " Pirates voice Rosey Roswell was wont to yell), cantankerous opinionating ("Trying to be fair and neutral about it, I can only say that the designated hitter rule is a travesty and ought to be tossed out") and ruminations on the ultimate metaphysical question of "why the Yankees exist." Throughout, the author stresses the game's continuities: modern-day anxieties about free agentry, labor strife and the bereavement of cities abandoned by their teams for greener pastures have plagued baseball from the beginning. Vivid, affectionate and clear-eyed, Vecsey's account makes for an engaging sports history. <i>(Aug. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Douglas Farrow explores key theological loci such as nature and grace and justification and sanctification; introduces theological giants such as Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, and Barth; and examines contemporary questions about sacraments and unity. Throughout his explorations, Farrow invites readers to consider how to negotiate controversy in Christian theology, especially between Catholics and Protestants, arguing that theology does its best work at the intersection of topics in dispute.</p><p>"Farrow offers a panoramic view of the crisis points in theology, combined with unpicking a number of long-standing theological knots. He is at home in the worlds of both Protestant and Catholic theology, and he brings the two together with recommendations for an irenic concordat. Farrow's style is engaging; the essays could be appreciated for their literary qualities alone, quite apart from the theological insights they contain."<br>--<b>Tracey Rowland</b>, John Paul&nbsp;II Chair of Theology, University of Notre Dame Australia<br><br>"This book will challenge Catholics and Protestants alike, for Farrow critically dissects some of the major issues that have divided and harassed them for five centuries. His knowledge of both traditions along with some of their major thinkers is impressive. For Farrow, being true to Scripture and right reason is essential to theology. Anyone serious about negotiating the philosophical and doctrinal complexities of ecumenical theology on those terms will find in Farrow a veteran envoy."<br>--<b>Thomas&nbsp;G. Weinandy, OFMCap</b><br><br>"All of the qualities we have come to expect of Farrow's thought--precision, incisiveness, and mastery--are on full display in this series of compelling essays. Writing with the verve and vigor that are his hallmarks, Farrow mines and unhesitatingly challenges the best of the theological tradition--Irenaeus, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, and Barth--shedding fresh light on crucial and seemingly intractable issues. Importantly, he accomplishes this with ecumenical concerns always in sight. <i>Theological Negotiations</i> is systematic theology at its finest."<br>--<b>Thomas&nbsp;G. Guarino</b>, Seton Hall University; cochairman, Evangelicals and Catholics Together<br><br>"Farrow's theology is robust and, like the gospel, ever ancient and yet ever new. It is also uncompromisingly biblical, catholic, and ecumenical. Farrow engages the dialectic of nature and grace as he surveys a wide range of fields: soteriology, sacraments, anthropology, and ecclesiology, among others. It is clear that what he calls the 'Pax Thomistica' is secure for the next generation and beyond. This is an important book."<br>--<b>Scott Hahn</b>, Franciscan University of Steubenville<br><br>"Farrow is profoundly Catholic, while ecumenically sensitive. He is deeply learned and utterly challenging in these essays on soteriology and anthropology. He refuses to accept easy answers for anything. He draws from the tradition to think through matters most rigorously and originally."<br>--<b>Gavin D'Costa</b>, University of BristolIn <i>Theological Negotiations</i>, leading theologian Douglas Farrow tackles some of his discipline's perennial challenges, including the relation between nature and grace, philosophy and theology, autonomy and freedom, justification and sanctification, Gentile and Jew, and Christ's offering and ours.<br><br>Controversial issues from supersessionism to transubstantiation to the perfection and final end of man are approached in new and innovative ways, showing what constructive theology looks like when it is determined to think eschatologically about the relations in question.<br><br>The innovation, however, is never at the expense of biblical and creedal parameters or of patient engagement with the Christian tradition and its formative thinkers. Along the way, Farrow invites readers to renegotiate, or at least to rethink, some key Catholic/Protestant differences in soteriology as well as some ill-advised compromises with contemporary autonomy-based anthropology.</p><h2>Moon Phase Whitetail Hunting</h2><p>The father of hunting deer by the moon, the man who started it all, Jeff Murray, shares his best kept secrets and insights on this fascinating aspect of white-tailed deer hunting. In his latest book on the subject, Murray teaches how to predict peak rutting activity and how to plan to be afield when big bucks are moving. Other topics include tactics to zone in on deer in transition areas and when, according to moon phase, deer will be at the field&#39;s edge and when they won&#39;t! This book also covers the different lunar cycles and how the moon triggers the rut activity.</p><p>Master Whitetail Hunter, Jeff Murray, broke ground with his theories on how the different phases of the moon affect whitetail behavior and movement patterns. Readers learn what moon phases make mid-morning hunting the best time to be afield and how to pinpoint the timing, intensity, and duration of the rut by using the New Moon formula. The book includes over 100 black-and-white photographs.<br>Jeff Murray is an award-winning journalist who has broken many stories in recent years--mule deer/whitetail hybridization, decoying deer, tracking bucks, whitetail vocalization--but he ranks his discoveries on deer and the moon as the most exciting. As a popular siminar speaker, Murray has shared his multimedia presentations with the Montana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota Bowhunters; Texas Trophhy Hunters; and Christian Deer Hunters Association. Popular topics include how the moon influences game animals and hunting strategies; scents, unscents, and nonsense; and little things that make a big difference for bowhunting success. In addition, Murray's popular and best-selling video series, Moonbeams, is available through major mail-order catalogs. Not surprisingly, Murray is a dedicated bowhunter who has harvested more than a dozen Pope and Young qualifying animals, including deer, bear, and elk.<br></p><h2>Gray Mountain</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The year is 2008 and Samantha Kofer&#x2019;s career at a huge Wall Street law firm is on the fast track&#x2014;until the recession hits and she is downsized, furloughed, and escorted out of the building. Samantha, though, is offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, all for a slim chance of getting rehired.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a matter of days Samantha moves from Manhattan to Brady, Virginia, population 2,200, in the heart of Appalachia, a part of the world she has only read about. Samantha&#x2019;s new job takes her into the murky and dangerous world of coal mining, where laws are often broken, communities are divided, and the land itself is under attack. But some of the locals aren&#x2019;t so thrilled to have a big-city lawyer in town, and within weeks Samantha is engulfed in litigation that turns deadly. Because like most small towns, Brady harbors big secrets that some will kill to conceal.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Gray Mountain</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[An] important new novel . . . superior entertainment.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Powerful . . . a satisfying, old-fashioned, good guy/bad guy legal thriller.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Yes, <i>Gray Mountain </i>is fiction.

Co-workers ignored each other and hid behind locked doors. Secretaries and paralegals passed along the rumors and refused eye contact. Everyone was on edge, wondering, "Who might be next?" The partners, the big boys, appeared shell-shocked and wanted no contact with their underlings. They might soon be ordered to slaughter them.<br><br>The gossip was brutal. Ten associates in Litigation terminated; partially true--only seven. The entire Estate division closed, partners and all; true. Eight partners in Antitrust jumping to another firm; false, for now.<br><br>The atmosphere was so toxic that Samantha left the building whenever possible and worked with her laptop in coffee shops around lower Manhattan. She sat on a park bench one pleasant day--day ten after the fall of Lehman Brothers--and gazed at the tall building down the street. It was called 110 Broad, and the top half was leased by Scully &amp; Pershing, the biggest law firm the world had ever seen. Her firm, for now, though the future was anything but certain. Two thousand lawyers in twenty countries, half of them in New York City alone, a thousand right up there packed together on floors 30 through 65. How many wanted to jump? She couldn't guess, but she wasn't the only one. The world's largest firm was shrinking in chaos, as were its competitors. Big Law, as it was known, was just as panicked as the hedge funds, investment banks, real banks, insurance conglomerates, Washington, and on down the food chain to the merchants on Main Street. <br><br>Day ten passed without bloodshed, as did the next. On day twelve there was a flash of optimism as Ben, one of Samantha's colleagues, shared a rumor that credit markets in London were loosening a bit. Borrowers might find some cash after all. But late that afternoon the rumor had run out of gas; nothing to it. And so they waited.<br><br>Two partners ran Commercial Real Estate at Scully &amp; Pershing. One was nearing retirement age and had already been shoved out. The other was Andy Grubman, a forty-year-old pencil pusher who'd never seen a courtroom. As a partner, he had a nice office with a distant view of the Hudson, water he hadn't noticed in years. On a shelf behind his desk, and squarely in the center of his Ego Wall, there was a collection of miniature skyscrapers. "My buildings" he liked to call them. Upon completion of one of his buildings, he commissioned a sculptor to replicate it on a smaller scale, and he generously gave an even smaller trophy to each member of "my team." In her three years at S&amp;P, Samantha's collection had six buildings, and that was as large as it would get.<br><br>"Have a seat," he ordered as he closed the door. Samantha sat in a chair next to Ben, who was next to Izabelle. The three associates studied their feet, waiting. Samantha felt the urge to grab Ben's hand, like a terrified prisoner facing a firing squad. Andy fell into his chair, and, avoiding eye contact but desperate to get things over with, he recapped the mess they were in.<br><br>"As you know, Lehman Brothers folded fourteen days ago."<br><br>No kidding, Andy! The financial crisis and credit meltdown had the world on the brink of a catastrophe and everyone knew it. But then, Andy rarely had an original thought.<br><br>"We have five projects in the works, all funded by Lehman. I've talked at length with the owners, and all five are pulling the plug. We had three more in the distance, two with Lehman, one with Lloyd's, and, well, all credit is frozen. The bankers are in their bunkers, afraid to loan a dime."<br><br>Yes, Andy, we know this too. It's front-page. Just get it over with before we jump.<br><br>"The exec committee met yesterday and made some cuts. Thirty first-year associates are being let go; some terminated outright, others laid off. All new hires are deferred indefinitely. Probate is gone. And, well, there is no easy way to say this, but our entire division is on the block. Cut. Eliminated. Who knows when owners will start building again, if ever. The firm is unwilling to keep you on the payroll while the world waits for loose credit. Hell, we could be headed for a major depression. This is probably just the first round of cuts. Sorry, guys. I'm really sorry."<br><br>Ben spoke first. "So we're being terminated outright?"<br><br>"No. I fought for you guys, okay? At first they planned to do the pink slip thing. I don't have to remind you that CRE is the smallest division in the firm and probably the hardest hit right now. I talked them into something we're calling a furlough. You'll leave now, come back later, maybe."<br><br>"Maybe?" Samantha asked. Izabelle wiped a tear but kept her composure. <br><br>"Yes, a big fat maybe. Nothing is definite right now, Samantha, okay? We're all chasing our tails. In six months we could all be at the soup kitchen. You've seen the old photos from 1929."<br><br>Come on, Andy, a soup kitchen? As a partner, your take-home last year was $2.8 million, average at S&amp;P, which, by the way, came in fourth in net-per-partner. And fourth was not good enough, at least it wasn't until Lehman croaked and Bear Stearns imploded and the sub-prime mortgage bubble burst. Suddenly, fourth place was looking pretty good, for some anyway.<br><br>"What's a furlough?" Ben asked.<br><br>"Here's the deal. The firm keeps you under contract for the next twelve months, but you don't get a paycheck."<br><br>"Sweet," Izabelle mumbled.<br><br>Ignoring her, Andy plowed ahead: "You keep your health benefits, but only if you intern with a qualified nonprofit. HR is putting together a list of suitable outfits. You go away, do your little do-gooder bit, save the world, hope like hell the economy bounces back, then in a year or so you're back with the firm and you don't lose any seniority. You won't be in CRE but the firm will find a place for you."<br><br>"Are our jobs guaranteed when the furlough is over?" Samantha asked.<br><br>"No, nothing is guaranteed. Frankly, no one is smart enough to predict where we'll be next year. We're in the middle of an election, Europe is going to hell, the Chinese are freaking out, banks are folding, markets are crashing, nobody's building or buying. The world's coming to an end."<br><br>They sat for a moment in the gloomy silence of Andy's office, all four crushed with the reality of the end of the world. Finally, Ben asked, "You, too, Andy?"<br><br>"No, they're transferring me to Tax. Can you believe it? I hate Tax, but it was either Tax or driving a cab. I got a master's in taxation, though, so they figured they could spare me."<br><br>"Congratulations," Ben said.<br><br>"I'm sorry, guys."<br><br>"No, I mean it. I'm happy for you."<br><br>"I could be gone in a month. Who knows?"<br><br>"When do we leave?" Izabelle asked.<br><br>"Right now. The procedure is to sign a furlough agreement, pack up your stuff, clean off your desk, and hit the street. HR will e-mail you a list of nonprofits and all the paperwork. Sorry, guys."<br><br>"Please stop saying that," Samantha said. "There's nothing you can say that helps matters here."<br><br>"True, but it could be worse. The majority of those in your boat are not being offered a furlough. They're being fired on the spot."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Andy," Samantha said. "There are a lot of emotions right now."<br><br>"It's okay. I understand. You have the right to be angry and upset. Look at you--all three have Ivy League law degrees and you're being escorted out of the building like thieves. Laid off like factory workers. It's awful, just awful. Some of the partners offered to cut their salaries in half to prevent this."<br><br>"I'll bet that was a small group," Ben said.<br><br>"It was, yes. Very small, I'm afraid. But the decision has been made."<br>A woman in a black suit and a black necktie stood at the quad where Samantha shared a "space" with three others, including Izabelle. Ben was just down the hall. The woman tried to smile as she said, "I'm Carmen. Can I help you?" She was holding an empty cardboard box, blank on all sides so no one would know it was the official Scully &amp; Pershing repository for the office junk of those furloughed or fired or whatever. <br><br>"No, thanks," Samantha said, and she managed to do so politely. She could have snapped and been rude, but Carmen was only doing her job. Samantha began opening drawers and removing all things personal. In one drawer she had some S&amp;P files and asked, "What about these?"<br><br>"They stay here," Carmen said, watching every move, as if Samantha might attempt to pilfer some valuable asset. The truth was that everything of value was stored in the computers--a desktop she used in her space and a laptop she took almost everywhere. A Scully &amp; Pershing laptop. It, too, would remain behind. She could access everything from her personal laptop, but she knew the codes had already been changed. <br><br>As if sleepwalking, she cleaned out the drawers and gently tucked away the six miniature skyscrapers from her collection, though she thought about tossing them into the trash can. Izabelle arrived and was given her own personal cardboard box. All others--associates, secretaries, paralegals--had suddenly found business elsewhere. Protocol had been quickly adopted--when someone cleans out a desk, let them do it in peace. No witnesses, no gawking, no hollow farewells.<br><br>Izabelle's eyes were puffy and red; she had obviously been in the restroom crying. She whispered, "Call me. Let's have a drink tonight."<br><br>"Sure," Samantha said. She finished stuffing it all into the box, her briefcase, and her bulky designer bag, and without looking over her shoulder she marched behind Carmen down the hallway and to the elevators on the forty-eighth floor. As they waited, she refused to look around and absorb it one last time. The door opened and thankfully the elevator was empty. "I'll carry that," Carmen said, pointing to the box, which was already increasing in bulk and weight. "No," Samantha said as she stepped inside. Carmen pushed the button for the lobby. Why, exactly, was she being escorted out of the building? The longer she pondered the question the angrier she became. She wanted to cry and she wanted to lash out, but what she really wanted was to call her mother. The elevator stopped on the forty-third floor and a well-dressed young man stepped in. He was holding an identical cardboard box, with a large bag strapped over his shoulder and a leather briefcase under an arm. He had the same stunned look of fear and confusion. Samantha had seen him in the elevator but never met him. What a firm. So mammoth the associates wore name badges at the dreadful Christmas party. Another security guard in a black suit stepped in behind him, and when everyone was in place Carmen again pressed the button for the lobby. Samantha studied the floor, determined not to speak even if spoken to. On the thirty-ninth floor, the elevator stopped again, and Mr. Kirk Knight got on board while studying his cell phone. Once the door closed, he glanced around, saw the two cardboard boxes, and seemed to gasp as his spine stiffened. Knight was senior partner in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and a member of the executive committee. Suddenly face-to-face with two of his victims, he swallowed hard and stared at the door. Then he suddenly punched the button for floor number 28.<br><br>Samantha was too numb to insult him. The other associate had his eyes closed. When the elevator stopped, Knight hustled off. After the door closed, Samantha remembered the firm leased floors 30 through 65. Why would Knight make a sudden exit onto 28? Who cared?<br><br>Carmen walked her through the lobby and out the door onto Broad Street. She offered a meek "I'm sorry," but Samantha did not respond. Laden like a pack mule, she drifted with the foot traffic, going nowhere in particular. Then she remembered the newspaper photos of the Lehman and Bear Stearns employees leaving their office buildings with boxes filled with their stuff, as if the buildings were on fire and they were fleeing for their lives. In one photo, a large color one on the front of the Times's section B, a Lehman trader was caught with tears on her cheeks as she stood helplessly on the sidewalk. <br><br>But those photos were old news now and Samantha did not see any cameras. She set the box down at the corner of Broad and Wall and waited for a cab.<br>2<br><br>In a chic SoHo loft that cost her $2,000 a month, Samantha flung her office crap at the floor and fell onto the sofa. She clutched her cell phone, but waited. She breathed deeply, eyes closed, emotions somewhat in check. She needed her mother's voice and reassurance, but she did not want to sound weak, wounded, and vulnerable. <br><br>The relief came from the sudden realization that she had just been freed from a job she despised. Tonight at seven she might be watching a movie or having dinner with friends, not slaving away at the office with the meter running. This Sunday she could leave the city with no thoughts whatsoever about Andy Grubman and the pile of paperwork for his next crucial deal. The FirmFone, a monstrous little gadget that had been glued to her body for three years now, had been surrendered. She felt liberated and wonderfully unburdened.<br><br>The fear came from the loss of income and the sudden detour in her career. As a third-year associate, she was earning $180,000 a year in base salary, plus a nice bonus. A lot of money, but life in the city had a way of devouring it. Half evaporated in taxes. She had a savings account, one she halfheartedly acknowledged. When you're twenty-nine, single, and free in the city, in a profession where next year's package will exceed this year's salary plus bonus, why worry too much about saving money? She had a friend from Columbia Law who'd been at S&amp;P for five years, had just made junior partner, and would earn about half a million this year. Samantha had been on that track.<br><br>She also had friends who jumped off the treadmill after twelve months and happily fled the awful world of Big Law. One was now a ski instructor in Vermont, a former editor of the Columbia Law Review, a refugee from the bowels of S&amp;P who lived in a cabin by a stream and rarely answered his cell. In just thirteen months he had gone from an ambitious young associate to a mildly deranged idiot who slept at his desk. Just before HR intervened, he cracked up and left the city. Samantha thought of him often, usually with a twinge of jealousy.</p><h2>History of Witchcraft</h2><p>The History of Witchcraft</p><p>The Reverend Montague Summers was a Roman Catholic priest. However, his views on witchcraft and demonology differed considerably from those of Catholic encyclopedists and spokesmen of today. He is not ashamed of the greatest excesses committed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. On the contrary, he vigorously defends everything the Church ever did to extirpate witchcraft and heresy. <p>"The History of Witchcraft" is one of the classic works on witchcraft and demonology. Unlike other writers on the subject, Dr. Summers firmly believed in the concept world of Satanism and described its nefarious nature with tremendous gusto. </p><p>This book was written from what critics have called a medieval viewpoint, an absolute and complete belief in witchcraft and, hence, in the supernatural. Among the subjects covered by Dr. Summers are: The Witch; Heretic and Anarchist; Demons and Familiars; the Sabbat; the Witch in Holy Writ; Diabolic Possession and Modern Spiritism; and the Witch in Dramatic Literature.</p>Montague Summers (1880&#x2013;1948) wrote numerous books on witches, vampires, and werewolves from a true believer's point of view. He also edited and translated several important early texts on demonology and witchcraft.</p><h2>Little by Little: Six Decades of Collecting American Decorative Arts</h2><p>An inspiring account of the superb collection of New England country arts of the 17th through the 19th centuries assembled little by little over six decades by Bertram K. and Nina Fletcher Little.</p><p>8 1/2 x 11 trim. 372 illus.

Her &#34;special contribution was to bridge the worlds of American antiques and folk art, bringing the antiquarian&#39;s passion for the past to the study of folk art. She combined a keen appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of an object with a determination to discover everything possible about the historical and social context in which it was created -- who made it, when and where, how it was used and by whom.

Nevertheless, she succeeded in forging a career, gaining respect, becoming a key player and creating a body of work that has stood the test of time. Her impressionism vibrates with light and spontaneity and yet possesses a density of form through the deft use of colour. Inevitably she painted what she experienced: scenes of intimate domestic and family life, gardens, flowers, landscapes &#x2013; representing the real, unfiltered day-to-day life of 19th-century women &#x2013; from the tender depiction of maternal love in The Cradle to the Far-Eastern inspired Julie with her Greyhound La�rte. <br><br>This gorgeous book introduces the reader to the background, life and work of the artist, followed by a curated selection of her best work in exquisite full-page reproductions.</p><p><b>Ann Kay</b> has edited or written a wide range of material on art and culture &#x2013; from books, magazines and journals to exhibition catalogues and websites, for all ages &#x2013; including work on two titles about the French Impressionist circle.

In this new work Hamlyn (University of London) has succeeded not only in chronicling the lives of the greater philosophers from Thales to Merleau-Ponty but in showing the influence of their ideas within a wider social and historical context. The book thus serves as a concise general outline to the major trends of Western intellectual thought in addition to being an excellent resource on individual philosophers. A short but well-selected annotated bibliography is provided for those who wish to read further. Clearly written and up to date, this book is highly recommended for students and general readers.

Lib., Madison, N.J.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hamlyn's survey is more than an academic history of ideas, for he attempts to weigh the achievements of the philosophers discussed and recreate their thought processes. His narrative is subtle and skeptical, as one would expect from someone who is himself a philosopher and editor of the journal Mind. Hamlyn stands Sartre on his head by arguing that existentialism is totally incompatible with Marxism. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who put the human body at the hub of phenomenal fields, is arguably the best French philosopher of this century, in the author's judgment. Another section explains why some people are repelled by Spinoza's monism (the belief that we are all modifications of the one substance, which is God). From the pre-Socratics of Asia Minor to Bertrand Russell and Michel Foucault, philosophers are challenged on their own turf by this succinct survey. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Renzo Piano Building Workshop; Complete Works Volume 2 (Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Paperback))</h2><p>This second volume on Renzo Piano provides a study of the architect&#39;s working method, followed by a presentation of his building projects from 1987-1993. In an interview with the author, Piano discusses his early career, his attitude toward technology and his continuing evolution of what the author has termed a natural architecture. Many of the completed buildings featured in the book are located in and around Piano&#39;s home town of Genoa, from the structures associated with the 1992 Expo in the old docks to the ground-hugging form of his own laboratory in Vesima.</p><p>This third volume closes poignantly with the completion of Piano&#39;s most monumental and extraordinary work, Kansai Airport. An introductory essay, &#34;From Pompidou to Kansai&#34;, reviews the full scope of his career. The most recent Renzo Piano Building Workshop projects are also included. These are described and illustrated with photographs and drawings which chart their development through design and construction stages, to completion. The last section of the book is dedicated exclusively to Kansai, describing the background to its design and construction, as well as a &#34;walkthrough&#34; that enables the reader to experience the building in a direct way.PETER BUCHANAN is a writer and critic who has served as deputy editor of the Architectural Review for nearly a decade.</p><h2>Safari Rifles II: Doubles, Magazine Rifles, and Cartridges for African Hunting</h2><p>Gone are the days of simple-solid and softpoint-bullets for a mere dozen-and-a-half African calibers.

Julian of Norwich, c. 8 November 1342 &#x2013; c. 1416, was an English anchoress and an important Christian mystic and theologian. Her Revelations of Divine Love, written around 1395, is the first book in the English language known to have been written by a woman. Julian was also known as a spiritual authority within her community where she also served as a counsellor and advisor. She is venerated in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran churches. When she was 30 and living at home, Julian suffered from a serious illness. Since she was presumed to be near death, her curate came to administer the last rites of the Catholic Church on 8 May 1373. As part of the ritual, he held a crucifix in the air above the foot of her bed. Julian reported that she was losing her sight and felt physically numb, but as she gazed on the crucifix she saw the figure of Jesus begin to bleed. Over the next several hours, she had a series of 16 visions of Jesus Christ, which ended by the time she recovered from her illness on 13 May 1373. Julian wrote about her visions immediately after they had happened (although the text may not have been finished for some years), in a version of the Revelations of Divine Love now known as the Short Text; this narrative of 25 chapters is about 11,000 words long. It is believed to be the earliest surviving book written in the English language by a woman. Twenty to thirty years later, perhaps in the early 1390s, Julian began to write a theological exploration of the meaning of the visions, known as The Long Text, which consists of 86 chapters and about 63,500 words. This work seems to have gone through many revisions before it was finished, perhaps in the 1410s or even the 1420s.</p><p>Julian of Norwich</p><h2>Vital Psoas Muscle</h2><p><b>Please Note That The Following Individual Books As Per Original ISBN and Cover Image In this Listing shall be Dispatched Collectively:</b><br><br> <b>The Vital Psoas Muscle: Connecting Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Well-Being:</b><br><br> <b>The Vital Psoas Muscle: Connecting Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Well-Being</b><br> Located deep within the anterior hip joint and lower spine, the psoas major (usually just referred to as the psoas) is critical for optimal postural alignment, movement, and overall well being.

These and other feelings are the stuff of our daily lives. This book the author draws on his experience with neurological patients to examine how feelings and the emotions that underlie them support the governance of human affairs.</p><p>As he seeks to unlock the secrets of such things as joy and sorrow, Antonio Damasio pursues a unifying theory in <i>Looking for Spinoza</i>. Why Spinoza? The philosopher, whom Damasio calls a "protobiologist," firmly linked mind and body, paving the way for modern ideas of neurophysiology. Damasio examines this linkage, which ran counter to all scientific and religious thinking of Spinoza's day, and lays out the reasoning and evidence behind its truth. As he has in his previous books on the subject (<i>Descartes' Error</i> and <i>The Feeling of What Happens</i>), Damasio is careful to use clear examples from life to explain the often dry and difficult science of the brain. When he wants readers to understand, for instance, brain stem control of emotions, he offers an Oliver Sacks-style case study of a man whose stroke left him unable to keep from bursting into tears or laughter at inappropriate times.<p> Damasio also defines his terms, which is crucial, as he means something very specific when he says <i>feeling</i> ("always hidden, like all mental images") instead of <i>emotion</i> ("actions or movements... visible to others as they occur in the face, in the voice, in specific behaviors"). Using an impressive array of biological and psychological research, Damasio makes a compelling case for his idea of the feeling brain as crucial for survival and sense of self. But this isn't just a book about brain science. It's a record of an intellectual journey, a diary of Damasio's musings about history, philosophy, and Spinoza's life, all wrapped up in a simply astonishing explanation of a subject most of us don't give a thought to--the feelings that we live by. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"In clear, accessible and at times eloquent prose, Damasio is outlining nothing less than a new vision of the human soul, integrating body and mind, thought and feeling, individual survival and altruism, humanity and nature, ethics and evolution." -SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE<br><br>JOY, SORROW, JEALOUSY, AND AWE-these and other feelings are the stuff of our daily lives. Thought to be too private for science to explain and not essential for understanding cognition, they have largely been ignored. But not by Spinoza, and not by Antonio Damasio. In Looking for Spinoza, Damasio, one of the world's leading neuroscientists, draws on his innovative research and on his experience with neurological patients to examine how feelings and the emotions that underlie them support human survival and enable the spirit's greatest creations. Looking for Spinoza rediscovers a thinker whose work prefigures modern neuroscience, not only in his emphasis on emotions and feelings, but in his refusal to separate mind and body. Together, the scientist and the philosopher help us understand what we're made of, and what we're here for.<br><br>"Exceptionally engaging and profoundly gratifying . . . Achieves a unique combination of scientific exposition, historical discovery and deep personal statement regarding the human condition." -NATURE<br><br>Antonio Damasio is the Van Allen Distinguished Professor and head of the department of neurology at the University of Iowa Medical Center and is an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. The recipient of numerous awards, he is a member<br>of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It is a creative synthesis of the core ideas of two of the modern west&#39;s greatest minds, Jung and Hegel. Informed throughout by his notion of &#34;complex holism,&#34; Kelly explores the dialectical relations between ego and unconscious, self and other, the individual and the absolute. Review: A ground-breaking work! Sea Kelly demonstrates convincingly that Hegel is Jung&#39;s philosopher and that Jung is Hegel&#39;s psychologist. Kelly&#39;s comparative and synthetic efforts unveil the common origin of philosophy, psychology, and religious experience in the deeper psyche.

When you first left the Earth, and travelled high and fast above its turning arc. When you looked down on a new world, captured simply and perfectly through a window fringed with ice. When you descended towards a city, and arrived from the sky as effortlessly as daybreak.<br><br>In <i>Skyfaring</i>, airline pilot and flight romantic Mark Vanhoenacker shares his irrepressible love of flying, on a journey from day to night, from new ways of mapmaking and the poetry of physics to the names of winds and the nature of clouds. Here, anew, is the simple wonder that remains at the heart of an experience which modern travellers, armchair and otherwise, all too easily take for granted: the transcendent joy of motion, and the remarkable new perspectives that height and distance bestow on everything we love.</p><p><p><br><br>MARK VANHOENACKER left academia to work as a management consultant, a position that afforded him regular opportunities to stare out of airplane windows and recall childhood dreams of becoming a pilot. He began his flight training in 2001. Today, as a Senior First Officer for British Airways, Mark flies Boeing 747s to major cities around the world. He is also a regular contributor to the <i>New York Times</i> and a columnist for <i>Slate</i>.

When I was a child I used to assemble model airplanes and hang them in my bedroom, under a ceiling scattered with glow-in-the-dark stars, until the day skies were hardly less busy than Heathrow&#x2019;s, and at night the outlines of the dark jets crossed against the indoor&nbsp;constellations.&nbsp;I looked forward to each of my family&#x2019;s occasional airplane trips with an enthusiasm that rarely had much to do with wherever we were going. I spent most of my time at Disney World awaiting the moment we would board again the magical vessel that had brought us there.<br> &nbsp;<br> At school nearly all my science projects were variations on an aerial theme. I made a hot-air balloon from paper, and sanded wings of balsa wood that jumped excitedly in the slipstream from a hairdryer, as simply as if it were not air but electricity that had been made to flow across them. The first phone call I ever received from someone other than a friend or relative came when I was thirteen. My mom passed me the telephone with a smile, telling me that a vice president from Boeing had asked to speak with me. He had received my letter requesting a videotape of a 747 in flight, to show as part of a science project about that airplane. He was happy to help; he wished only to know whether I wanted my 747 to fly in&nbsp;VHS&nbsp;or Betamax format.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am the only pilot in my family. But all the same, I feel that imaginatively, at least, airplanes and flying were never far from home. My father was completely enthralled by airplanes&#x2014;the result of his front-row seat on the portion of the Second World War that took place in the skies above his childhood home in West Flanders. He learned the shapes of the aircraft and the sounds of their engines. &#x201c;The thousands of planes in the sky were too much competition for my schoolbooks,&#x201d; he later wrote. In the 1950s, he left Belgium to&nbsp;work as a missionary in the Belgian Congo, where he first flew in a small airplane. Then he sailed to Brazil, where in the 1960s he was one of surely not very many priests with a subscription to&nbsp;<i>Aviation Week</i>&nbsp;magazine. Finally he flew to America, where he met my mother, went to business school, and worked as a manager in mental health services. Airplanes fill his old notes and slides.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother, born under the quieter skies of rural Pennsylvania, worked as a speech therapist and had no particular interest in aviation. Yet I feel she was the one who best understood my attachment to the less tangible joys of flight: the old romance of all journeys, which she gave to my brother and me in the form of stories like&nbsp;<i>Stuart Little</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Hobbit,</i>&nbsp;but also a sense of what we see from above or far away&#x2014;the gift, the destination, that flying makes not of a distant place but of our home. Her favorite hymn was &#x201c;For the Beauty of the Earth,&#x201d; a title, at least, that we agreed might be worth printing on the inside of airplane window blinds.<br> &nbsp;<br> My brother is not a pilot. His love is not for airplanes but for bicycles. His basement is full of bikes that are works in progress, that he&#x2019;s designing and assembling from far-gathered parts, for me or for a grateful friend. When it comes to his bike frames, he is as obsessed with lightness as any aeronautical engineer. He likes to make and fix bikes even more than he likes to ride them, I think.<br> &nbsp;<br> If I see my brother working on one of his two-wheeled creations, or notice that he&#x2019;s reading about bikes on his computer while I am next to him on the couch reading about airplanes, I may remember that the Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics, and that their skyfaring skills began with wheels, a heritage that suddenly becomes clear when you look again at their early airplanes. When I see pictures of such planes I think, if I had to assemble anything that looked like this, I would start by calling on the skills of my brother&#x2014;even though there was the time I got him in trouble with our parents for skipping his chores, and so he taped firecrackers to one of my model airplanes and lit the fuses and waited just the right number of seconds before&nbsp;throwing the model from an upstairs window, in a long arc over the backyard.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a teenager I took a few flying lessons. I thought that I might one day fly small airplanes as a hobby, on weekend mornings, an aside to some other career. But I don&#x2019;t remember having a clear wish to become an airline pilot. No one at school suggested the career to me. No pilots lived in our neighborhood; I don&#x2019;t know if there were any commercial pilots at all in our small town in western Massachusetts, which was some distance from any major airport. My dad was an example of someone who enjoyed airplanes whenever he encountered them, but who had decided not to make them his life&#x2019;s work. I think the main reason I didn&#x2019;t decide earlier to become a pilot, though, is because I believed that something I wanted so much could never be practical, almost by definition.<br> &nbsp;<br> In high school I spent my earnings from a paper route and restaurant jobs on summer homestay programs abroad, in Japan and Mexico. After high school I stayed in New England for college but also studied in Belgium, briefly reversing the journey my father had made. After college I went to Britain to study African history, so that I could live in Britain and, I hoped, in Kenya. I left that degree program when I finally realized that I wanted to become a pilot. To repay my student loans and save the money I expected to need for flight training, I took a job in Boston, in the&nbsp;field&#x2014;management consulting&#x2014;that&nbsp;I thought would require me to fly most often.<br> &nbsp;<br> In high school I certainly wanted to see Japan and Mexico, and&nbsp;to study Japanese and Spanish. But really, what attracted me most to such adventures was the scale of the airplane journeys they required. It was the possibility of flight that most drew me to far-off summer travels, to degree programs in two distant lands, to the start of the most literally high-flying career I could find in the business world, and at last&#x2014;because none of even those endeavors got me airborne nearly often enough&#x2014;to a career as a pilot.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was ready to start my flight training, I decided to return to&nbsp;Britain. I liked many aspects of the country&#x2019;s historic relationship with aviation, its deep tradition of air links with the whole world, and the fact that even some of the shortest flights from Britain are to places so very different from it. And, not least, I liked the idea of living near the good friends I&#x2019;d made as a postgraduate there.<br> &nbsp;<br> I began to fly commercially when I was twenty-nine. I first flew the Airbus A320 series airliners, a family of narrow-bodied jets used on short- to medium-distance flights, on routes all around Europe. I&#x2019;d be woken by an alarm in the 4&nbsp;a.m. darkness of Helsinki or Warsaw or Bucharest or Istanbul, and there would be a brief bleary moment, in the hotel room whose shape and layout I&#x2019;d already forgotten in the hours since I&#x2019;d switched off the light, when I&#x2019;d ask myself if I&#x2019;d only been dreaming that I became a pilot. Then I would imagine the day of flying ahead, crossing back and forth in the skies of Europe, almost as excitedly as if it was my first day. I now fly a larger airplane, the Boeing 747. On longer flights we carry additional pilots so that each of us can take a legally prescribed break, a time to sleep and dream, perhaps, while Kazakhstan or Brazil or the Sahara rolls steadily under the line of the wing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frequent travelers, in the first hours or days of a trip, may be familiar with the experience of jet lag or a hotel wake-up call summoning them from the heart of night journeys they would otherwise have forgotten. Pilots are often woken at unusual points in their sleep cycles and perhaps, too, the anonymity and nearly perfect darkness of the pilot&#x2019;s bunk form a particularly clean slate for the imagination. Whatever the reason, I now associate going to work with dreaming, or at least, with dreams recalled only because I am in the sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> A chime sounds in the darkness of the 747&#x2019;s bunk. My break is over.&nbsp;I feel for the switch that turns on a pale-yellow beam. I change into my&nbsp;uniform, which has been hanging on a plastic peg for something like 2,000 miles. I open the door that leads from the bunk to the cockpit. Even when I know it&#x2019;s coming&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s frequently hard to know, depending as it does on the season, the route, the time, and the place&#x2014;the brightness always catches me off guard. The cockpit beyond the bunk is blasted with a directionless daylight so pure and overwhelming, so alien to the darkness I left it in hours ago and to the gloom of the bunk, that it is like a new sense.<br> &nbsp;<br> As my eyes adjust, I look forward through the cockpit windows. At this moment it&#x2019;s the light itself, rather than what it falls upon,&nbsp;that is the essential feature of the earth. What the light falls&nbsp;upon is the Sea of Japan, and far across this water, on the snowcapped peaks of the island nation we are approaching. The blueness of the sea is as perfect as the sky it reflects. It is as if we are slowly descending over the surface of a blue star, as if all other blues are to be mined or diluted from this one.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I move forward in the cockpit to my seat on the right side of it, I think briefly back to the trip I made to Japan as a teenager, about two decades ago, and to the city this plane left only yesterday, though <i>yesterday</i>&nbsp;isn&#x2019;t quite the right word for what preceded a night that hardly deserves the name, so quickly was it undone by our high latitudes and eastward speed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember that I had an ordinary morning in the city. I went to the airport in the afternoon. Now that day has turned away into the past, and the city, London, lies well beyond the curve of the planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I fasten my seat belt I remember how we started the engines yesterday. How the sudden and auspicious hush fell in the cockpit&nbsp;as the airflow for the air-conditioning units was diverted; how&nbsp;air alone began to spin the enormous techno-petals of the fans, spin them and spin them, faster and faster, until fuel and fire&nbsp;were added, and each engine woke with a low rumble that grew to a smooth and unmistakable roar&#x2014;the signature of one of our age&#x2019;s most perfect means of purifying and directing physical power.<br> &nbsp;<br> In legal terms a journey begins when &#x201c;an aircraft moves under its own power for the purpose of flight.&#x201d; I remember the aircraft that moved ahead of us for this purpose and lifted ahead of us into the London rain. As that preceding aircraft taxied into position its engines launched rippling gales that raced visibly over the wet runway, as if from some greatly speeded-up video recording of the windswept surface of a pond. When&nbsp;<i>takeoff thrust</i>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<i>set</i>&nbsp;the engines hea...</p><h2>Deal Breaker</h2><p>Investigator and sports agent Myron Bolitar is poised on the edge of the big-time.

He lives in Oxford, England.<i>Part One<br> Paris, March 1953.</i><br><br>The Church of Saint-Germain des Pres, at the start of what was supposed to be Spring, is a miserable place, made worse by the drabness of a city still in a state of shock, worse still by the little coffin in front of the altar which was my reason for being there, worse again by the aches and pains of my body as I kneeled. <br><br>She'd died a week before I arrived. I hadn't even realised she was still alive; she must have been well into her eighties, and the hardships of the past few years had weakened many a younger person. She would not have been impressed, but something approaching a real prayer for her did come into my mind, just before I struggled back onto the pew. Age has few compensations; the indignity of discomfort, the effort to conceal constant nagging pain, is most certainly not one of them. <br><br>Until I read the Figaro that morning and saw the announcement, I had been enjoying myself. I was on a farewell tour; the powers-that-be had scraped together enough foreign currency--called in a few favours at the Bank of England even--to allow me to travel. My last visit to the foreign bureaux before I retired; to Paris. Not many people could do that sort of thing these days--and would not until foreign exchange restrictions were lifted. It was a little mark of respect, and one that I appreciated. <br><br>It was a fine enough service, I thought, although I was not an expert. The priests took their time, the choir sang prettily enough, the prayers were said, and it was all over. A short eulogy paid tribute to her tireless, selfless work for the unfortunate but said nothing of her character. The congregation was mainly freshly scrubbed and intense-looking children, who were clipped around the ear by teachers if they made any untoward noise. I looked around, to see who would take charge of the next round, but no one seemed to know what to do. Eventually the undertaker took over. The body, he said, would be interred in Pere Lachaise that afternoon, at two o'clock, at 15, Chemin du Dragon. All who wished to attend were welcome. Then the pallbearers picked up the coffin and marched out, leaving the mourners feeling lost and cold.<br><br>"Excuse me, but is your name Braddock? Matthew Braddock?"<br><br>A quiet voice of a young man, neatly dressed, with a black band around his arm. I nodded, and he held out his hand. "My name is Whitely," he said. "Harold Whitely, of Henderson, Bailey, Fenton. I recognised you from newsreels." <br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"Solicitors, you know. We dealt with Madame Robillard's residual legal business in England. Not that there was much of it. I am so glad to meet you; I was planning to write in any case, once I got back."<br><br>"Really? She didn't leave me any money, did she?"<br><br>He smiled. "I'm afraid not. By the time she died she was really quite poor."<br><br>"Goodness gracious me," I said, with a smile. <br><br>"Why the surprise?"<br><br>"She was very wealthy when I knew her."<br><br>"I'd heard that. But I knew her only as a sweet old lady with a weakness for worthy causes. But I found her charming, on the few occasions we met. Quite captivating in fact."<br><br>"Yes, that's her," I replied. "Why did you come to the funeral?"<br><br>"A tradition of the firm," he said with a grimace. "We bury all our clients. A last service. But, you know--it's a trip to Paris, and there's not much opportunity of that these days. Unfortunately, I could get hold of so little currency I have to go straight back this evening." <br><br>"I have a little more than that, so would you care for a drink?"<br><br>He nodded, and we walked down the Boulevard Saint-Germain to a cafe, past the grim buildings blackened with the filth of a century or more of smoke and fumes. Whitely--formerly Captain Whitely, so he told me--had a slightly annoying tendency to grip my elbow at the difficult bits to make sure I did not trip and fall. I didn't mind, although the assumption of decrepitude was a little annoying. <br><br>A good brandy; she deserved no less, and we drank her health by the plate glass window as we sat on our rickety wooden chairs. "Madame Robillard," we intoned, several times over, becoming more garrulous as we drank. He told me of life in Intelligence during the war--the time of his life, he said wistfully, now gone for good and replaced with daily toil as a London solicitor. I told him stories of reporting for the BBC; of D-Day, of telling the world about the Blitz. All yesterday, and another age.<br><br>"Who was her husband?" I asked. "I assume he is long dead."<br><br>"Robillard died about a decade ago. He ran the orphanages and schools with her."<br><br>"Is that why there were all those children in the church?"<br><br>"I imagine so. She started her first home after the war--the first war. There were so many orphans and abandoned children, and she somehow got involved with them. By the end there were about ten or twelve schools and orphanages, I gather, all run on the very latest humanitarian principles. They consumed her entire fortune, in fact, so much so that I imagine they will all be taken over by the state now."<br><br>"A good enough use for it. When I knew her she was married to Lord Ravenscliff. That was more than forty years ago, though." <br><br>I paused. Whitely looked blank. "Have you heard of Ravenscliff?" I enquired.<br><br>"No," he said. "Should I have?"<br><br>I thought, then shook my head. "Maybe not. He was an industrialist, but most of his companies disappeared in the Depression. Some closed, others were bought up. Vickers took over some, I remember. The lone and level sands stretch far away, you know."<br><br>"Pardon?"<br><br>"Nothing." I breathed in the thick air of cigarette smoke and damp, then attracted the waiter's eye and called for more drinks. It seemed a good idea. Whitely was not cheering me up at all. It was quiet; few people around, and the waiters were prepared to work hard for the few customers they had. One of them almost smiled, but managed to restrain himself.<br><br>"Tell me about her," I said when we were refilled once more. "I hadn't seen her for many years. I only discovered she was dead by chance."<br><br>"Not much to say. She lived in an apartment just up the road here, went to church, did good works, and outlived her friends. She read a great deal, and loved going to the cinema. I understand she had a weakness for Humphrey Bogart films. Her English was excellent, for a Frenchwoman."<br><br>"She lived in England when I knew her. Hungarian by birth, though." <br><br>"Apart from that there's nothing to say, is there?"<br><br>"I suppose not. A quiet and blameless life. What were you going to write to me about?"<br><br>"Hmm? Oh, that. Well, Mr. Henderson, you know, our senior partner. He died a year ago and we've been clearing out his papers. There was a package for you."<br><br>"For me? What is it? Gold? Jewels? Dollar bills? Swiss watches? I could use some of those. We old age pensioners . . ."<br><br>"I couldn't say what's in it. It's sealed. It was part of the estate of Mr. Henry Cort . . ."<br><br>"Goodness."<br><br>"You knew him, I assume?"<br><br>"We met, many years ago."<br><br>"As I say, part of the Cort estate. Curious thing is that it carried instructions that you were to be given it only on Madame Robillard's death. Which was very exciting for us. There isn't much excitement in a solicitor's office, let me tell you. Hence my intention to write to you. Do you know why?"<br><br>"I have absolutely no idea. I scarcely knew Cort at all, and certainly haven't even cast eyes on him for more than thirty years. I came across him when I was writing a biography of Madame Robillard's first husband. That's how I knew her as well."<br><br>"I hope it was a great success."<br><br>"Unfortunately not. I never finished it. The reaction of most publishers was about as enthusiastic as your own was when I mentioned his name."<br><br>"My apologies."<br><br>"It was a long time ago. I went back to being a journalist, then joined the BBC when it started up, after the war. The first war. When did Cort die?" Curious how, the older you get, the more important other people's deaths become.<br><br>"1944."<br><br>"When I get back, send me your package. If it's valuable, I'll be glad to get it. But I doubt it will be. As far as I remember, Cort didn't like me very much. I certainly didn't like him."<br><br>And then we ran out of things to say to each other, as strangers of different generations do. I paid and began my old man's routine of wrapping myself up, coat hat, scarf, gloves, pulling everything tight to keep out the bitterness of the weather. Whitely pulled on a thin, threadbare coat. Army demob, by the look of it. But he didn't seem half as cold as I was just thinking of going outside.<br><br>"Are you going to the cemetery?"<br><br>"That would be the death of me as well. She would not have expected it, and probably would have thought me sentimental. And I have a train at four. When I get back I will dig out my old notes to see how much I actually remember, and how much I merely think I remember."<br><br>I took my train from the Gare de Lyon that afternoon, and the cold of Paris faded, along with thoughts of Madame Virginie Robillard, formerly Elizabeth, Lady Ravenscliff, as I went south to the greater warmth of a Mediterranean spring. <br><br>She remained in the back of my mind wherever I went, whatever I saw, until I returned to my little house in Hampstead to dig out my old notes. Then I went to visit Mr. Whitely.<br><br>Chapter One<br>London, 1909<br><br> When I became involved in the life and death of William John Stone, First (and last) Baro...</p><h2>National League Baseball Card Classics</h2><p>The National Baseball League <i>was</i> baseball for the game&#x2019;s first quarter-century of professional life. By 1900 the eight clubs that would carry the National League through its next 62 years were established, and though the Giants, Dodgers, and Braves would relocate, they and others (Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, and Philadelphia Phillies) carefully preserved their traditions and memories.<br>Their greatest memories were of course the players, men whose character and statistics made national heroes out of National Leaguers. Here are the greatest, preserved, as America preserves its heroes, painted not on canvas but cardboard: 78 different players on 83 authentic classic baseball cards.<br>The facsimiles, reproduced front and back with the original advertising, span 60 years, 1909-69, from Frederick Merkle and Johnny Evers to Lou Brock.

Vivid verso commentary notes that Adolfo Luque (New York Giants, 1933) is &#x201c;the only Cuban now playing in the National League,&#x201d; while Charles &#x201c;Chick&#x201d; Hafey (Cincinnati Reds, 1934) is &#x201c;one of the best players in the National League, despite the fact that he is forced to wear glasses.<br>The League has changed; the tobacco and gum aromas have long worn off these cards&#x2019; rare originals (worth thousands to collectors) &#x2014; but these facsimiles, reproduced on baseball card stock, retain the flavor that made card collecting a co-equal national pastime.

The authors have made numerous national radio and television appearances discussing their experiences with gURL and teen girl issues.From the creators of the teen website gURL.com and the authors of the national bestseller Deal With It! comes this chirpily upbeat sophomore effort ("a three-part investigation into how looks affect our lives-and how we can take beauty into our own hands") that will undoubtedly appeal to style- and looks-obsessed adolescents and tweens. An impressive amount of information is crammed into these whimsically art-directed and sometimes busy pages: there's history (fashion through the ages) anatomy (body types and body parts), psychology (body image) and even comedy (the plentiful cartoons that poke gentle fun at female body obsession). Everything from nose jobs to breast size to pubic hair gets discussed in a non-threatening and usually bubbly way (Christianity put the "official kibosh" on makeup; "boobs are pretty great" whatever their size). There are, of course, the requisite celebrity references; here they're most effectively used to illustrate different fashion types: there's Grace Kelly as Ice Queen, Jennifer Lopez as Diva, Mae West as Goddess and Venus and Serena Williams as Power Jocks (accompanying illustrations deconstruct their looks). While frothy fashion and beauty factoids abound, the basic message of empowerment-that girls should be happy with their inner and outer selves-is presented here with intelligence and humor. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Comic Book Implosion: An Oral History of DC Comics Circa 1978</h2><p>Things looked bleak for comic books throughout the 1970s because of plummeting sell-through rates. With each passing year, the newsstand became less and less interested in selling comic books. The industry seemed locked in a death spiral, but the Powers That Be at DC Comics had an idea to reverse their fortunes. In 1978, they implemented a bold initiative: Provide readers with more story pages by increasing the price-point of a regular comic book to make it comparable to other magazines sold on newsstands. Billed as &#x201c;The DC Explosion,&#x201d; this expansion saw the introduction of numerous creative new titles. But mere weeks after its launch, DC&#x2019;s parent company pulled the plug, demanding a drastic decrease in the number of comic books they published, and leaving stacks of completed comic book stories unpublished. The series of massive cutbacks and cancellations quickly became known as &#x201c;The DC Implosion.&#x201d; TwoMorrows Publishing marks the 40th Anniversary of one of the most notorious events in comics with an exhaustive oral history from the creators and executives involved (Jenette Kahn, Paul Levitz, Len Wein, Mike Gold, and Al Milgrom, among many others), as well as detailed analysis and commentary by other top professionals, who were &#x201c;just fans&#x201d; in 1978 (Mark Waid, Michael T.

Her recommendations are followed by millions today. She is the leading spokesperson for the organic foods movement. She is known for popularizing the phrase &#x201c;You Are What You Eat&#x201d;. When you see organic food stores all over and special organic foods shelves in supermarkets, think of Adelle Davis as the person who popularized all of this. Her movement became popular because of the increased use of pesticides, chemicals, additives and fertilizers to increase food production. Davis wrote a series of four books, starting with a cookbook in 1947, that ultimately sold over 10 million copies in total. Although her ideas were considered somewhat eccentric in the 1940s and 1950s, the change in culture with the 1960s brought her ideas, especially her anti-food processing and food industry charges, into the mainstream in a time when anti-authority sentiment was growing. She also contributed to, as well as benefited from, the rise of a nutritional and health food movement that began in the 1950s, which focused on subjects such as pesticide residues and food additive. During the 1960s and 1970s, her popularity continued to grow, as she was featured in multiple media report. Her celebrity was demonstrated by her repeated guest appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as she became the most popular and influential nutritionist in the country.</p><p>She was born in Lizton, Indiana on February 25, 1904. Her first book was Optimum Health published in 1935. This book did not have a publisher. The first book to make her famous was a cook book published in 1947: Let&#39;s Cook it Right. This was followed by Let&#39;s Have Healthy Children (1951) and Let&#39;s Eat Right to Keep Fit (1954). Adelle Davis died on 31 May 1974 in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Invasion</h2><p>A sudden outbreak defies diagnosis-because the causes are unlike anything humankind has ever seen... <br><br> "Cook fans will revel in this story." (<i>Booklist</i>)</p><p>Fans of Robin Cook's many thrillers will be happy to know another one is on the way. In this latest outing, <i>Invasion</i>, Cook envisions a contact with extraterrestials that is closer to <i>Alien</i> than to <i>E.T.</i>. A gigantic spaceship arrives in the stratosphere to dump some black disks onto Earth. Touch these things at your own risk, however; unsuspecting souls who handle the disks receive a sting, soon followed by flulike symptoms and ending in a kind of zombie assimilation into the alien consciousness. And make no mistake: these aliens are up to no good--we know this because the victims of the UFO-flu are soon transformed into hideous reptilian creatures.<p> Apparently, one consequence of being trapped by the aliens is that victims lose all semblance of natural speech--most notably, contractions. The book abounds in dialogue such as, "You must flee, Cassy," and "The electrical grid has been interrupted. There will be no force counteracting the antigravity ..." Still, readers looking for a good beach or bathtub book will find <i>Invasion</i> is right on the money.</p>Dr. Robin Cook is the author of thirty previous books, most recently <em>Nano</em>, and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his wildly successful first novel, Coma.

Not far away, a wounded stranger, drenched in blood-- not all of it his own-- is carried to sanctuary by a wandering bard. And a mystery linked to warring passions for a woman and a nation begins for Owen Archer.<br><br>Owen, leaving his family behind, has undertaken a holy pilgrimage to Wales with his ailing father-in-law and his friend Geoffrey Chaucer-- and has agreed to carry out a mission for the English king. But he is unexpectedly moved by his return to his native land.

She writes full-time.<br>Another labyrinth adventure for one-eyed Welshman Owen Archer (The Riddle of St. Leonards, 1997, etc.), captain of the Archbishop of Yorks retainers in 14th-century England. This time, Owen is to journey to Wales, his long-unseen homeland, to recruit archers for the Duke of Lancaster, bolstering the Dukes forces against a rumored (soon-to-come) attack on England by King Charles of France. Owen is accompanied by Geoffrey Chaucer, whose mission is to inspect and report on the fortifications at the Dukes Welsh castles, overseen by his steward John Lascelles. Traveling with them are Owens ailing father-in-law, Sir Robert DArby, and Brother Michaelo, the Archbishops secretary, both on a pilgrimage to St. Davids shrine. Owen is to meet with John de Reine, the stewards son, at Castle Carreg Cernen, but de Reines murdered body has been left at the Tower Gate of St. Davids. Owen and Geoffrey offer to escort the body, in company with Father Edern, to his fathers home at Castle Cydweli. Once there, a second killing occurs and Lascelles beautiful wife Tangwystl vanishes, along with Father Edern. Tangwystls father is Gruffydd, deeply involved in a money scam and said to have ties to the infamous traitor Owain Lawgoch. There are endless comings and goings, a surfeit of characters and conflicts, and much soul-searching as Owen rediscovers his roots, suffers a deep personal loss, identifies the killer, and prepares to return home. A literate, meticulously researched jumble of confusing subplots and unpronounceable names. In all, a disappointing sixth outing for this often enthralling author. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Through the working-class consciousness of its female narrator, it celebrates the democratic ideals of the early O'Sullivans who find themselves among Yankee, Polish, and 'lace-curtain' Irish neighbors in a mill town in western Massachusetts.

I celebrate the republication of her moving novel and its story of class, bondage, and the courage of women in the early days of Irish immigration to the United States, and in the hard years that followed.

It is grand to have <i>The Parish and the Hill</i> back in print." <b>Maureen Howard, author of <i>Facts of Life</i></b><br><br>"This lyric and haunting novel about three generations of Irish immigrants deserves a visible place in the multi-ethnic tradition of American literature. Through the working-class consciousness of its female narrator, it celebrates the democratic ideals of the early O'Sullivans who find themselves among Yankee, Polish, and 'lace-curtain' Irish neighbors in a mill town in western Massachusetts. The text's classic storytelling, mythic framework, and memorable minor characters make this a most 'teachable' novel." <b>Margo Culley, editor of <i>American Women&#x2019;s Autobiography: Fea(s)ts of Memory</i></b><br><br>"By using their own words and the perspective of a young girl narrator, Mary Doyle Curran not only recreates three generations of an Irish immigrant family but poignantly evokes their faith in the American dream, their bewilderment as they see their hope fade, and the dignity with which they accept their roles as outsiders." <b>Mary Anne Ferguson, author of <i>Images of Women in Literature</i></b><br><br>"Mary Curran was my teacher at Wellesley in the late forties, the only teacher I had at college who asked new questions. She first published <i>The Parish and the Hill</i> in those years, telling the truth about Irish-Americans as she taught us to seek the truth in other less conventional, uncanonized literature. I celebrate the republication of her moving novel and its story of class, bondage, and the courage of women in the early days of Irish immigration to the United States, and in the hard years that followed. This is a fine novel from those dark, postwar years by a memorable woman who illuminated those years for me and many others." <b>Carolyn G.

Original.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> Annika Hansen, Agent Seven of Corps Nine for the Obsidian Order, waited patiently for her quarry to appear. Agent Seven had been undercover on Khitomer for several days, having been surgically altered to appear as a female Klingon warrior by the physicians of the Cardassian intelligence agency. </p><p> The other females in the Khitomer communal house accepted Seven's story that she had jumped ship to avoid her captain's wrath over a shipment of isolinear coprocessors that had gone astray. She claimed she was now trying to earn her passage back to Qo'nos, the Klingon Homeworld. </p><p> In the dark recesses of the hall, Agent Seven lightly scratched the Klingon ridges on her forehead. As part of her disguise, her hair had been lengthened, frizzed, and colored dark brown. The traditional female armor covered every part of her body except her chest, leaving her vulnerable to a knife attack in the finest Klingon tradition. To defend herself, she had spiked boots and gloves, and her three-bladed <i>d'k tahg,</i> honed razor sharp. </p><p> Agent Seven's current mission had come straight from Enabran Tain. She was ordered to assassinate Duras, son of Ja'rod. The intelligence brief Tain had downloaded into her cranial implant database had included the fact that Duras frequented this particular establishment whenever he was on Khitomer. </p><p> Seven's decision to infiltrate this communal house had paid off. For the past three evenings, the Duras sisters had visited the house looking for a woman to keep company with Duras. Tonight, Seven had no intention of allowing them to leave without her. Her orders from Tain were clear. She must complete the assassination before the Cardassian delegation arrived on Khitomer for the Alliance gathering. Then she had to withdraw from Klingon territory without being detected. </p><p> A fine mist covered Khitomer, drifting through the open spaces between the slanting black columns of the communal house. Seven was in the base of the pyramidal building, whose upper levels were lined by rows of tiny square windows. The first two floors were open, forming an atrium on a wide stone terrace. Iron lamps hanging from the high ceiling gave off a fuzzy glow that barely penetrated the darkness. When the clouds rose from the moist ground, Seven could see the cliffs of the nearby mountains. Usually visibility was near zero. </p><p> Agent Seven leaned against a slanted column next to the entryway preferred by the Duras sisters. Other Klingon women were drifting down from their rooms on the upper floors to lounge on the benches scattered throughout the atrium. Since Khitomer was in close proximity to the Romulan front, these were fierce women, battle scarred and ready for action. </p><p> Seven's tight leather gloves, doubly thick to hide her slender fingers, reminded her of her first Klingon simulation at the Obsidian Order training facility. That experience had gone on for weeks as she attempted to complete her assignment -- assassinating a Klingon official called Gorloth, son of Poq. </p><p> Maybe she was thinking of that first training simulation because of its similarities to this assignment. Then she had posed as an available Klingon woman in the darker side of town, attempting to draw Gorloth's attention and maneuver him into a position where she could kill him. </p><p> But the training simulation seemed very far away, and Seven had to think hard to remember that although she had been playing a Klingon seductress, she had actually just entered puberty. She had been scared that she wouldn't succeed and her trainers would punish her. It made her bold and daring, despite the seemingly real surroundings. </p><p> It was a valid fear, because sometimes the training simulations turned out to be real. Seven remembered questioning everything during that first assignment. She hadn't been in space in years, not since she was six years old on her parents' ship before it crashed on a deep-space Cardassian colony. She had spent the entire time wondering: Is this ship really moving? Are those stars real? Is this pilot an Obsidian Order agent, a hologram of one, or a real pirate? Time she should have spent getting into character had been wasted. </p><p> Other trainees often argued over whether the Obsidian Order surprised them with real assignments because they were needed for the job, or because the uncertainty kept them on constant alert. It was true that trainees came and went, casualties in the line of duty. Seven never grew close to any other trainee. They were shifted from one undercover character to the next, complete with physical and psychological modifications. Even when they were in group training situations, they didn't recognize one another. </p><p> Seven had failed her first assignment, and luckily it had been a simulation. But a few subsequent sessions had turned out to be real. Her training had been thorough, and now it was second nature to slip into her required cover. Seven had become Melka, daughter of Kagh. Her real self lay tightly curled inside the Klingon shell, watching her own actions with analytical detachment as she bared her teeth at a towering female, hissing slightly to force her away from the choice spot by the entry columns. </p><p> Agent Seven knew she was good because she had received her orders directly from Enabran Tain. Tain had seen her worth when she was only a child and had accepted her into the Obsidian Order. With her parents dead, Annika Hansen had first been adopted into a high-ranking Cardassian family. Yet despite a physique altered to make her appear Cardassian, the Ghemor family could not fully accept a Terran as a daughter. After only one year, Ghemor had sent her to the Obsidian Order, making it clear that the Terran slave camps were her only option if she failed again. </p><p> The mist parted from the entryway as the Duras sisters appeared. Lursa was matronly despite her unmarried state, with a perpetually sour expression. Pretty B'Etor stayed close behind her elder sister's shoulder, forever in her shadow. They scanned the hall; Lursa's mouth puckered in distaste. B'Etor peered enviously around her sister, perhaps desiring the freedom of these warriors. </p><p> Seven stayed back for a moment as Lursa imperiously rejected the first women who approached. Duras had a reputation for being a passionate and honorable Klingon, one of the few men who had earned the respect of the communal women. However, it would lower the family's status if Lursa took the first offers she received. </p><p> When Lursa hesitated and began to inspect one female with serious intent, Seven made her move. With several long strides, her hand poised on the d'k tahg at her waist, Seven reached the Duras sisters. Catching them by surprise, Seven thrust the fawning communal woman aside. </p><p> Seven spit after her. "Duras, son of Ja'rod, deserves better than a mewling kitten!" </p><p> "Who tells <i>us</i> what our brother deserves?" Lursa demanded contemptuously. </p><p> "I am Melka, daughter of Kagh," Seven replied, loud enough for the entire hall to hear. "But any woman here would tell you the same. Duras, son of Ja'rod, deserves only the best." </p><p> Lursa was eyeing Seven with new interest. "Are you the best?" </p><p> Seven laughed, showing off her pointed teeth. "I leave <i>that</i> for you to decide." </p><p> Lursa and B'Etor examined her as Seven stood with her hand on the knife. It was like acting in a holoplay. Inwardly, her eyes were rolling at the overdone gestures and ritual displays of dominance. Yet Seven flawlessly executed the behavior best designed to obtain compliance, sorting instantaneously through the suggestions her cranial implant whispered directly to her mind. </p><p> Now her undercover work paid off. The communal women had learned to respect her and none dared to challenge her, even with Duras as the prize. Lursa looked from Seven to the women huddled back in the wan glow of the lamps. </p><p> "It grows late," B'Etor murmured. </p><p> Lursa abruptly</p></p><h2>The Bloodied Cravat (Beau Brummell Mysteries)</h2><p>While attending the Duchess of York&#39;s birthday celebration, London&#39;s arbiter of fashion Beau Brummell is called upon to solve a mystery when one of the guests is murdered with one of the duchess&#39;s hair ornaments.</p><p>Rosemary Stevens lives outside Richmond, Virginia, with her husband and two children.

Renowned for his sartorial splendor and elegance, Brummell has come to Oatlands, the country home of the Duke and Duchess of York, to be with Frederica, the duchess, as she celebrates her birthday while her husband is off with his mistress. When a highwayman robs Robinson, his valet, en route to Oatlands, Brummell isn't as concerned about his lost clothes as he is about his stolen blue-velvet-covered scrapbook, which contains a letter from Frederica that if made public could cause a royal scandal and Brummell's social downfall. After the universally disliked Marquess of Kendrick threatens blackmail and is subsequently murdered, Frederica calls in Mr. Lavender of Bow Street. As the investigation progresses and the murders mount, the author expertly uses red herrings to keep Brummell and the reader guessing. A multitude of authentic historical figures add to the fun in this vivid portrait of Regency England. Stevens deftly captures the magnificence of the wealthy's country estates and the glittering atmosphere of London at the height of the social season.

The waves were calm at this time of day, an endless beat that once had been the rhythm of his childhood. The sky was darkening, a storm coming in with savage quickness. It was one of the things he&#x2019;d always loved about this place. One minute the sky was perfect, and then some terrible storm would roll in, and thirty minutes later the world was back to flawless again.</p><p>If only his life had turned out to be so quick to change. Oh, it had gotten shitty fast, but the cleanup afterward seemed like it might take a lifetime.</p><p>He let the coffee cup he held warm his hands and concentrated on the beach. When he looked out over that sand, he could practically see his grandfather walking. The old man who&#x2019;d raised him had walked the shoreline every single day, combing the beach he&#x2019;d known for decades as though he would find something new. He would show back up with some shell or sand dollar like it was a treasure.</p><p>Damn but he missed that old man.</p><p>Sometimes he didn&#x2019;t though. He was happy his grandfather hadn&#x2019;t lived long enough to see the complete wreck Henry had made of his life. Along with his daily walk on the beach, Alistair Garrison had sat right here on this porch and read the New York Times every single morning while sipping his two cups of coffee. Never more, because that would be too indulgent.</p><p>Control and discipline, my boy. Those are the keys to life.</p><p>Yeah, his grandfather hadn&#x2019;t lived long enough to watch his only grandchild, the golden boy, fall from grace because of booze and arrogance. He hadn&#x2019;t had to watch as the New York Bar had nearly taken away his ability to practice law. He hadn&#x2019;t been alive to witness the downfall of his grandson&#x2019;s made-for-the-tabloids marriage, and Henry was sure as hell happy he hadn&#x2019;t been alive to know that his precious house was being put on the market to pay off a never-ending series of bills he&#x2019;d run up when he&#x2019;d been married. He&#x2019;d bought cars and houses and other shit he didn&#x2019;t need.</p><p>Most of which he didn&#x2019;t even own anymore. He&#x2019;d had to sell almost everything to simply keep his head above water. He&#x2019;d blown it all on booze and luxury vacations and clothes with price tags that would have made his grandfather roll over in his grave.</p><p>Henry gripped the coffee cup with both hands, willing himself to stay out here on the porch and not go back inside the small but beautifully decorated bungalow. That had been his grandmother&#x2019;s doing, and he reminded himself that he was happy she hadn&#x2019;t witnessed his tragedy either.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been packing up the closet in the smaller of the two bedrooms when he&#x2019;d found a wooden box containing a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of photos. They were black-and-white and color. Some had been professionally done&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s army photo, his grandfather&#x2019;s wedding portrait, Henry&#x2019;s Harvard graduation portrait. Some had been from the various cameras his grandfather had used over the years. There had also been a Bible with a pressed white rose in it. His mother&#x2019;s.</p><p>Pictures of the dead. Pictures of people who&#x2019;d smiled and had lives, and then they were gone and he was left behind.</p><p>But those bittersweet memories weren&#x2019;t what had prompted Henry to practically run out of the house.</p><p>Nope. It had been the small bottle of Scotch he&#x2019;d found. There had been almost half the bottle left. He&#x2019;d looked at that liquid gold and known exactly how it would taste, how it would smell, the way it would burn down his throat. He&#x2019;d stared at it and figured he could get three decent glasses out of it. He could go to the kitchen, grab one of the crystal tumblers his grandmother had been proud of, and sit and toast all that death.</p><p>He&#x2019;d dropped the bottle on the carpet and walked out of the house. He&#x2019;d walked to the small caf� two blocks from the beach and ordered a large coffee and told himself that he could keep the monster locked in that room. He would simply sell the contents of the house along with the structure.</p><p>The problem was, the monster didn&#x2019;t live in the bottle. The monster was with Henry always.</p><p>His cell trilled, and he practically breathed a sigh of relief. Work was something he could deal with. Work was an addiction he could sink into. He set the cup down and answered the call. &#x201c;This is Garrison.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, buddy. How&#x2019;s the packing going?&#x201d; David Cormack&#x2019;s voice came over the line, a steady sound that soothed Henry. There was something about the ex&#x2013;NFL star turned lawyer that Henry found oddly calming. David never flipped his shit, never got angry or emotional, but managed to also never seem cold.</p><p>David&#x2019;s whole world had turned upside down, all his hopes and dreams burned to cinders, and all he&#x2019;d done was find a new dream.</p><p>Henry would bet that not once had David ever had a drunken screaming argument with his wife in the middle of a Manhattan restaurant with a phalanx of reporters documenting every moment for posterity.</p><p>Of course, David was a widower. He didn&#x2019;t argue with his wife at all.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting through it. I only got in yesterday. I&#x2019;m going to pack up anything personal and let the movers take the rest.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t going to talk to David about the fact that he was on the back porch hiding out from a bottle of Scotch. David had enough to deal with. &#x201c;Did the kid get in all right?&#x201d;</p><p>The kid was named Noah Lawless, and he was the only fucking reason Henry Garrison was still going to be able to practice law in Manhattan. After his disastrous divorce, he didn&#x2019;t have the influence or the cash flow to keep up his private practice. Manhattan&#x2019;s best criminal lawyer had become a has-been, and only his connection to the incredibly powerful Lawless family was saving him this time.</p><p>Once upon a time, he&#x2019;d defended Riley Lawless&#x2019;s future wife from embezzlement and fraud charges. Not that she&#x2019;d needed much defending, since she&#x2019;d actually been innocent, but getting Ellie out of jail had apparently endeared him to the clan, and when he&#x2019;d needed help, they&#x2019;d been amenable. They were funding him for the time being. They were also his only real client.</p><p>Of course, that meant doing Drew Lawless, the family patriarch and head of their multibillion dollar company, a massive favor and taking on his baby brother as a freaking junior partner. But a desperate man did what he had to do. Noah wasn&#x2019;t coming in as an associate, the way he should. He had his damn name on the door.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not as bad as you think.&#x201d; David knew how reluctant Henry was to take on an entitled kid. He&#x2019;d dealt with enough rich pricks to last a lifetime.</p><p>Despite the fact that he was sitting on one of the world&#x2019;s most affluent islands, he hadn&#x2019;t grown up wealthy. The house had been built by his boat captain great-grandfather back in the 1920s and passed down the line. His grandfather had been a fisherman, and his father had gone into the military. After his father had died, Henry had grown up here as a townie. It had only been later on that he&#x2019;d turned into an overprivileged asshole of a human being.</p><p>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s probably pretty bad, so you&#x2019;re not giving me a lot of confidence.&#x201d; Henry wished he hadn&#x2019;t stopped smoking. No more smoking. No more drinking. No more random, meaningless sex. Being virtuous was starting to get to him. He needed a good murder case, and soon, or he wouldn&#x2019;t know what to do with himself. &#x201c;The kid went to Creighton Academy. They&#x2019;re all rich jerks who never worked a day in their lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not what you would think, and you know his background. He practically raised himself. I like him. And he&#x2019;s damn good with computers,&#x201d; David said, his enthusiasm coming over the line.</p><p>&#x201c;I would think he should be.&#x201d; The Lawless family money was built on technology. 4L Software was known for innovation. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why he didn&#x2019;t go into tech in the first place. He could be working at 4L.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you don&#x2019;t know him as well as I do. Read the files I send you every now and then. Or at least pretend to. He used to be a hacker, and it got him into some trouble. Things got violent, and he wants to stay as far away from that world as possible. When he went to college, he liked the law classes he took, and here he is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, big brother bought him a law firm.&#x201d; And two partners. There was really no way around that. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s also got a multimillion-dollar penthouse. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll be supereasy to deal with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can the sarcasm, please,&#x201d; David admonished. &#x201c;As I was trying to explain, he&#x2019;s worth more than the cash he&#x2019;s bringing in, and he is very helpful. The network went down, and he got it up and working long before the IT guy I called managed to get to the office. By the way, we could use an in-house IT guy.&#x201d;</p><p>They could use a lot of things they weren&#x2019;t going to get. &#x201c;Find me his salary in our budget and we&#x2019;ll talk. Until then, the Creighton kid can do it, apparently. How did the meeting with Keillor go?&#x201d;</p><p>Greg Keillor was a Wall Street businessman accused of murdering his business partner. The police believed he had one hell of a motive. A quarter of a billion dollars was worth killing over in a lot of people&#x2019;s minds. It was exactly the kind of case Henry liked to sink his teeth into. High-profile, tons of billable hours, a client who could pay his freaking bill. Yeah, he wanted in on that. He&#x2019;d been back in New York for less than a year, and most of his cases had been small-time. He&#x2019;d done a couple of pro bono, mea culpa I&#x2019;m-still-a-beast cases, but it was time to move back into prime time.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, man. Keillor decided to go with Dustin and Klaus.&#x201d; There was something tight in David&#x2019;s tone.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; If this had been three years ago, Keillor would have been begging to have the Monster of Manhattan as his attorney. Henry Garrison would have been the first number he called. Henry would have been the one to make sure the case was worth his time.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was today.</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; David insisted.</p><p>&#x201c;It matters to me.&#x201d; He should let it go, but he couldn&#x2019;t. Now it was almost more real than it had been before, because now he wasn&#x2019;t simply Henry Garrison, Esquire. He was a member of Garrison, Cormack, and Lawless. He&#x2019;d brought himself down. How much harder would it be to bring them all down? After all, he hadn&#x2019;t meant to do it the first time.</p><p>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t interested in a lawyer who was more scandalous than he was,&#x201d; David replied, his tone wry. &#x201c;See? He&#x2019;s a massive ass if he thinks divorcing your actress wife is more scandalous than beating his business partner to death with a polo mallet. Also, might I add that he was a shitty polo player and that was the most action his mallet ever saw. I don&#x2019;t want him as a client.&#x201d;</p><p>That was David. He looked to the silver lining. &#x201c;You need to think about this, man. I know we&#x2019;ve been friends for a long time, but you might do better on your own.&#x201d;</p><p>It was an argument they&#x2019;d had many times since the night his old friend had come to him and offered to start up a law firm. Henry had pointed out that no one wanted an addict, who couldn&#x2019;t even keep a wife, as a lawyer.</p><p>David had pointed out that no one would want a washed-up jock, who hadn&#x2019;t been known for his brains, as a lawyer.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop. There&#x2019;s no going back now. We&#x2019;re in this and we&#x2019;re a team. And you know it&#x2019;s not all bad,&#x201d; David quipped. &#x201c;This office is small but spectacular. Drew Lawless knows how to pick real estate. The view impresses the hell out of everyone. I&#x2019;ve already got two clients, and one of them is the Missiles. We should be rolling in dough soon, because you know how those athletes can be.&#x201d;</p><p>He sighed in relief. David had been trying to get on as the Manhattan Missiles&#x2019; lawyer on retainer for months. It was a secret no one liked to talk about, but many professional sports teams kept criminal lawyers on retainer just in case. They wouldn&#x2019;t be rolling in dough, as he&#x2019;d said, but that retainer would keep the lights on. And it was a serious win for his friend. &#x201c;Good for you, man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, the new GM is an old friend of mine,&#x201d; David admitted. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re the one who told me half this business is who you know. Speaking of who you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there&#x2019;s a rumor floating around that a group of New York&#x2013;based reality stars are hanging around Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard for the end of the summer. No cameras. Apparently this is vacation time, so they might be willing to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>He groaned. That was not a world he wanted to set foot in. He&#x2019;d been around the elite of the entertainment world, and they were bad enough. Reality shows were pretty much the bottom of the barrel. &#x201c;Absolutely not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on. You know that&#x2019;s a gold mine,&#x201d; David countered, his voice going low. It was the same tone he used when trying to get a jury to see his point. Look at how sensible I&#x2019;m being. Don&#x2019;t mind the facts. Isn&#x2019;t my voice soothing? He had to admit it. David had that shit down. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s publicity, Henry. You&#x2019;re the one who taught me getting your name out there is half the battle. This would be a great way to announce you&#x2019;re back and you&#x2019;re not afraid of anything. It&#x2019;s work just waiting to happen. They always get in trouble. It&#x2019;s actually a part of their career paths. If their ratings stall, they get arrested and do an apologetic media tour. That group has been going for more than five years now. They&#x2019;re all about to hit thirty, and that&#x2019;s geriatric on their network. Rumors are it&#x2019;s going to get canceled soon. One of those kids is going to do something stupid, and we could be the lawyers who get paid for mopping up the mess.&#x201d;</p><p>The thought made Henry&#x2019;s stomach churn. He glanced out over the beach. It was peaceful. So unlike his former life. At this time of evening, the families had gone in for early dinners and the only person he could see was a woman jogging toward him from the east side of the island.</p><p>She was brave, because that storm was moving in even faster than he&#x2019;d thought. There wasn&#x2019;t much the way she was going. No shops unless she made a turn and jogged into Edgartown proper.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not getting back into that life&#x2014;even as the janitor,&#x201d; Henry replied. &#x201c;Besides, after the way I left L.A., I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a studio or a network around that would recommend anything with my name on it.&#x201d;</p><p>That had been the real mistake. He&#x2019;d followed his bombshell actress wife out to La La Land, and that&#x2019;s where it had all gone to hell. He should never have left the East Coast. God, there were pictures of him in douchebag V-neck T-shirts and skinny jeans. What had he been thinking?</p><p>He&#x2019;d come back to New York with his tail between his legs and a big decision to make. Keep the home he&#x2019;d grown up in or the Manhattan condo that impressed potential clients. In the end, there had been no other logical choice. The Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard property was worth even more than the condo, but he couldn&#x2019;t practice out here. Oh, he was perfectly licensed to practice in the state of Massachusetts, but there wasn&#x2019;t much to do. The worst thing that happened out here was someone&#x2019;s Maltipoo violating the dog-doo rules.</p><p>Unfortunately, the murders were few and far between.</p><p>&#x201c;Think about it,&#x201d; David said with a sigh. &#x201c;I know you hate the fact that you have to climb the ladder ag...</p></p><h2>Triumph in Arms (The Masters at Arms, 6)</h2><p><br><br>Once a starveling bootblack, Christien Lenoir has risen to become the sword master known as <em>Faucon,</em> the Falcon.

She closed the ledger in which she was copying figures from the bills of lading for goods that had been delivered at the plantation steamboat landing that morning. Rising to her feet, she grimaced at the ink staining her fingers. She should hurry and wash her hands before descending to greet the visitor.<br><br>But really, what was the point? The gentleman was doubtless only a crony of her father's. He would join him where he rested on the lower gallery, which was comfortably shaded by massive live oaks at this hour. With glasses of Madeira in hand, the two of them would discuss the price of cotton and the latest political scandals. She would be free to return to her desk work once the obligatory compliments were out of the way.<br><br>Stretching a little, she moved to her sitting room's French doors, which stood open to the morning air. Sunlight lay in a broad swath over the canvas that carpeted the gallery floor, reflecting from its white surface with blinding brilliance. Reine shaded her eyes with one hand as she gazed out at the front drive that curved its way down to the river road.<br><br>A horseman cantered toward the house, kicking up puffs of dust that formed a small comet tail behind him. Tall and broad of shoulder, he sat his saddle with the ease of one born to it. A wide-brimmed planter's hat of summer straw shaded his face, while the folds of a long gray dust coat protected his clothing. He was too far away for his features to be visible, yet something about him seemed familiar.<br><br>Reine felt a small frisson run down her spine. She was not a fanciful female by any means, yet it seemed the sun dimmed as if a cloud passed over it. The heat of the day waned, leaving her chilled and unaccountably disturbed.<br><br>A goose walking on her grave, she told herself with an abrupt shake of her head. That was all. Turning with decision, she crossed to the hallway and made her way down the stairs.<br><br>Alonzo, the white-haired butler who had been a fixture at River's Edge since before she was born, awaited her at their foot. She asked him to see that refreshments were provided on the lower gallery. As he moved away to do her bidding, she drew a deep breath and walked out the open front door, pausing on the steps of the white-columned portico.<br><br>The visitor had just reached the gate that closed off the pathway through the front garden. He was definitely not a friend of her father's, Reine saw; the muscular grace with which he swung from the saddle was that of a man in his prime, one no stranger to physical exertion. He did not lack for assurance, for he tossed his reins to the stable boy who came running and pushed open the gate in the picket fence as if returning home instead of paying a social call. The way he gazed around him, taking in the grass-covered rise of the Mississippi River levee, the front garden behind its fencing, the big white house and waving fields of young cane behind it, was keenly appraising. No master on watch for signs of negligence could have been more thorough.<br><br>Alonzo, his assignment completed, stepped through the front door and came to a halt behind Reine. She was heartily glad of his silent support. The arrival of Chalmette, her brother's big, rawboned bloodhound that emerged from his cool wallow under the hydrangea shrubs, also improved her feelings. She did not reprove the dog as he raised his ruff with a low growl and planted himself in front of her.<br><br>"Good day, <em>monsieur" </em>she greeted the visitor in polite tones. "May we be of service?"<br><br>He turned toward her, reaching at the same time to remove his hat. Lowering it to rest against the swinging fullness of his long dust coat, he stood square-shouldered and grim of face before her.<br><br>"You!"<br><br>Shock wrenched that single word from her. The tone of her voice disturbed the hound, for he growled again in deep-throated warning. She put a quieting hand on his head.<br><br>"As you say, Madame Pingre," the visitor answered with a brief tip of his head. "Christien Lenoir, at your service."<br><br>Dark hair with the black satin gleam of a swamp panther's pelt, deep-set dark eyes, strong features that carried a copper-bronze tint: this was the man who lived nightly in Reine's dreams, yes, and her nightmares. It was he who had saved her and Marguerite from being mangled by carriage wheels or worse on that terrible night four months ago. For an instant, she was back in his arms again, lying against his hard length, caught to him in a hold so secure it seemed nothing could harm her, not then, not ever.<br><br>The urge to sink into that infinite protection had been so seductive she was forced to steel herself against it. Anger at her weakness and the impossibility of ever having someone to share her blighted existence washed over her in that instant. Though it pained her to remember it now, she had screamed at this man like a harridan as she scrambled up and dragged her daughter away from him.<br><br>The heat of a flush rose to her hairline. It was all she could do to sustain his piercing gaze. What mischance had brought him to River's edge she could not imagine, but the sooner he was on his way, the better. "I ask again if I may direct you, <em>monsieur."</em><br><br>"I've come on a matter of business with your father. That is, if he is at home."<br><br>"What could you possibly have to discuss with him?" The question was less than gracious, though the best Reine could manage at the moment.<br><br>"You doubt my invitation to call?"<br><br>A dangerous undertone shaded Christien Lenoir's voice, she thought. It was a reminder of a similar dark peril seen in his eyes as they had faced each other in a muddy street. Fear had meshed with the anger inside her as she recognized it, but beneath both had been a strange exhilaration. They had been muddy, disheveled, bruised and shaken, but for a brief instant there flashed between them an awareness so searing she had felt branded by it. They had stood staring at each other, a heartbeat away from quarreling, until Marguerite began to cry.<br><br>Just thinking of it now made Reine feel as if her blood had turned hot and scouring in her veins, mounting to her brain. It was difficult to recall what he had just asked.<br><br>"I...I must confess to being surprised," she said finally. "My father is expecting you, then?"<br><br>"He should be," he said in cryptic reply.<br><br>She hesitated, then stepped back, gesturing toward the side gallery. "That way, if you please. Alonzo will take your hat and dust coat, then show you to him."<br><br>"You're very kind, <em>madame."</em><br><br>His voice was dry, the look in his eyes ironic as he came up the steps toward her. He seemed a veritable paladin, impossibly tall and wide of shoulder and with his coat flowing around his heels like a cloak. If the presence of the bloodhound troubled him, he gave no sign but only held out a hand for him to sniff. Chalmette availed himself of that privilege, gave a wag of his tail, then trailed away in the direction of the hydrangea again.<br><br>Reine gave the dog a jaundiced look. As she glanced back at the visitor, she caught a glimpse of amusement in his eyes, as if he understood her annoyance at Chal-mette's defection. She only inclined her head in leave-taking before turning away to reenter the house.<br><br>It was possible he paused to watch her departure. She could not be sure for she did not look back.<br><br>The visitor's arrival was such a distraction that it was difficult to return to her paperwork. When she had placed half a dozen sums in the wrong column, entered one set twice and added a column three times with as many different answers, she flung down her pen and left the writing table once more.<br><br>A small mirror hung in a gilded frame above the console table between the French doors. She stepped to it, frowning at her reflection. Her hair, never particularly neat, had sprung into a mass of wild wisps around her face in the souplike summer air. Her face was flushed in a less-than-attractive fashion, and, yes, that was a smudge of India ink on her chin.<br><br>With an exclamation of annoyance, she slipped her handkerchief from the embroidered, drawstring pocket that dangled at her waist along with her keys. She moistened it with her tongue and scrubbed hard at the stain. Not that she cared what she looked like, of course. She had never been more than passably attractive, but she preferred at least to be clean.<br><br>What business could Monsieur Lenoir possibly have at River's Edge? She could not think her father required instruction in the use of fencing foil or sword; he had been proficient once, though that was years ago. He owned no property on the Passage de la Bourse that might be rented out as a sword master's atelier as far as she was aware. He was of too mild of a temper to contemplate engaging a <em>ma�tre d'armes </em>to rid himself of an enemy. That was, of course, if Monsieur Lenoir could be brought to hire out his sword for such a purpose; only the least respectable of the fencing masters were so lost to honor as to stoop to such arrangements.<br><br>The only other thing she could imagine was a debt of honor. Her father was a fine man but had one vice, an addiction to games of chance. It had been years since he allowed it to overcome his better judgment, though Reine's mother sometimes spoke of the days before their marriage when he had won and lost several fortunes. Regardless, he came up short of funds now and again after a particularly long night of play. Yes, and there had been that evening not so long ago when he had come home only as the roosters crowed.<br><br>Dismay seeped over Reine as she became certain she had hit upon the reason for the sword master's visit. Her father owed a gambling debt.<br><br>Cash to pay it off was in short supply; she knew that well enough, having spent the morning toting up the accounts. Not that such a state of affairs was unusual; most planters lived on their expectation of future profit. Harvest time usually saw their hopes rewarded, but not always. A single crop destroyed by drought, insects, disease or storms, and ruin could overtake them. That was unless friends or a benevolent banker came to their rescue.<br><br>Her father had been fortunate in his friends and business acquaintances thus far. A convivial man, he was generous to a fault when in funds, always cheerful in company and as affable when losing as when winning at the card table. He made few enemies, which he often proclaimed to be the secret of a good life.<br><br>Reality and her dear papa were not on close terms, however; he made a habit of ignoring unpleasant facts for as long as possible. More than that, he did not believe in burdening females with financial worries. This in spite of it being Reine who kept track of plantation profits and expenditures. Though her affection was deep and abiding, her knowledge of his faults gave her a bad feeling about this unusual visit.<br><br>The need to know precisely how matters stood between her father and Monsieur Lenoir became more acute with every passing moment. It was a relief when Alonzo appeared to tell her that she was required on the gallery.<br><br>The visitor and her father rose at her approach, then sank back into their seats as she took a wicker chair and folded her hands in her lap. Her father made a hearty show of recalling the identity of their guest to her memory and expressing yet again his gratitude for his good services in preventing injury to Reine and Marguerite outside the theater. With that out of the way, he fell uncharacteristically silent, glancing from her to his visitor with a worried frown between faded blue eyes. He shifted his gaze out over the gallery railing to the moving patches of sunlight under the oaks. He looked at the caller again, cleared his throat and pursed his lips.<br><br>Her father was growing older, Reine noticed with a small clutch at her heart. Liver spots marked the backs of his hands, his features were grooved with lines and his dark hair streaked with silver. A bon vivant as a young man, he had married rather late in life so had been almost forty when she was born. Events these past few years had taken their toll, stealing the spring from his step and the sprightliness and laughter from his smile. For much of that she was to blame, as she knew far too well.<br><br>"Yes, Papa?" she asked after a moment. "You have something you wish to tell me?"<br><br>"Indeed. There is a matter... That is, I must relate... Oh, it's a damnable thing, and I'm more sorry than I can say. It concerns you more than any other, and it seemed best that I let you know first so you can... Ah, <em>ch�re!"</em><br><br>Reine's apprehension, already strong, turned to alarm. She sat forward. "What is it? Has something happened? Tell me at once!"<br><br>Her father opened his mouth and closed it again with a shake of his head. Reine, feeling the gaze of the sword master upon her face, swung toward him in hope of clarification.<br><br>Thankfully, he did not disappoint her.<br><br>"What your father is trying to tell you, Madame Pingre," he said, his voice as steady as his black gaze, "is that he has lost title to this property. The house, its furnishings, workers and acreage has passed from him over the gaming table. His loss is my gain. I am the new owner of River's Edge."<br><br>The words he spoke were clear enough, but her mind refused to accept their meaning. This was worse, so much worse, than she had feared. "What? What did you say?"<br><br>"It's true," her father said in mournful concurrence as she turned back to him. "Everything is gone. The town house in the Vieux Carr�, as well."<br><br>"I am sorry," Lenoir said.<br><br>Reine closed her eyes, unable to bear what was surely the spurious regret in his voice or the implacability in his features. "Gaming," she said, the damning word no more than a whisper in her own ears.<br><br>"Euchre." Her father's voice regained strength now that the news was out. "My luck was abominable. Truly, I never saw it so bad. I was sure it would turn as the night went on, but alas, it never happened." He gave a fatalistic shrug.<br><br></p><h2>The Ralph Wiggum Book (Simpsons Library of Wisdom)</h2><p><p>The Ralph Wiggum Book is an all&#x2013;new book from the new series: The Simpsons Library of Wisdom.</p><p> There's more to Ralph than meets the eye.

It is Dermot's first time in Spain and the first time he's been out of Birmingham in many years. When he finally arrives at the gates of the crumbling development, Dermot learns that Eamonn, only one of a handful of settlers in the half-finished ghost town of Lomaverde, has fallen prey to an alluring vision and is upside down in a dream that is slipping away.</p><p>But Dermot finds something beautiful and nostalgic in Lomaverde's decline&#x2015;something that is reminiscent of his childhood in Ireland. Soon he is the center of attention in the tiny group of expats where paranoid speculation, goat hunting, and drinking are just some of the ways to pass the days.

She lives in Birmingham, England.1 <p>2008</p> <p>He arrived on a cloudless day. As he stepped onto the tarmac, he looked up at the sky and saw nothing but blue and the traces left by other planes.</p> <p>The terminal was deserted. He wandered along polished floors with a handful of other passengers. Music was playing somewhere. An old tune, he couldn&#x2019;t remember the name. It was not how he&#x2019;d imagined airports. It seemed more like a ballroom to him. Something grand and sad about the place.</p> <p>Walking through a sliding door, he found himself in the arrivals hall, confronted by a crowd of people crushed up against the rail, waving pieces of paper and looking at him expectantly. Scanning the faces and signs, he smiled apologetically for not being their man. He looked beyond them, to others who hung back and leaned against walls, but saw no trace of Eamonn. He had never assumed that he would be able to meet him. It wasn&#x2019;t always possible to just drop what you were doing.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Eamonn wasn&#x2019;t sure how long he&#x2019;d been awake or if what had passed before had been sleep. He seemed to have been conscious for hours, lying inert in a kind of trance. He rolled onto Laura&#x2019;s empty side of the bed and picked up the barely there scent of her perfume, citric and uncertain. He sat on the edge of the bed for a moment, waiting to recover.</p> <p>He sidled over to the window, opening the shutters an inch before slamming them closed again. He tried once more, pulling back slowly, keeping his gaze downcast, watching color flood the floor tiles. His feet retained their mortuary hue, luminously pale on the terra-cotta slabs.</p> <p>When he thought his eyes could stand it, he looked out of the window. It was just as he&#x2019;d known. Another day, dazzling and merciless.</p> <p>He found the pay phones and pulled an address book out of his bag. The book was ancient, a faded lady with a parasol on the cover, the Sellotape holding it together dried out and yellow. The pages bulged with various additions and amendments on old letters, birthday cards, and torn scraps of a tea-bag box. Looking for Eamonn&#x2019;s details, he came across the phone numbers of various friends and family long dead or forgotten. It was strange to think that by pressing a few buttons he might hear some of their voices again. The book contained his and Kathleen&#x2019;s entire life, and the information it held was almost all obsolete.</p> <p>When he found the number, he realized he&#x2019;d need coins, and suddenly it was all too much bother and messing about when he could be off and on the road already. He was happy to make his own way. He thought there were few places you couldn&#x2019;t reach with a decent map and public transport.</p> <p>He found the buses easily enough at the airport. He boarded one with the name of what looked like a fairly large town, in the general direction of Eamonn&#x2019;s place. The woman driver gave a small nod when he attempted his pronunciation of the place. Receiving change was the first thing that really struck him as foreign. He wondered if she appreciated how much grief she avoided by not insisting on exact fares.</p> <p>Eamonn was hungry. He rooted listlessly in the kitchen cupboards, conscious that he had done the same thing the previous day, and maybe the day before that too. He found the madeleine cake hitherto rejected for the dark stain of mold on its underside. He cut away the exterior, leaving a cubic inch of untainted yellow sponge, which he put on a plate and took out onto the balcony along with a cup of stale mint tea.</p> <p>He sat on the terrace, looking over at the shared swimming pool. It had been empty for almost a year, the chlorinated water replaced with a thin layer of pine needles. He noticed that a family of cats had moved in overnight, locating themselves in the deep end on a discarded Cheetos box. Lomaverde had proven to be a popular destination for hardworking cats and their families. The legion of them snaking in the shadows around the bins had steadily grown. It was hard to tell if fresh residents were continuing to flood in or if the original settlers were simply reproducing rapidly in the promised land.</p> <p>He was startled by the door buzzer&#x2014;a strange skip to his heart as he pressed the button, thinking: &#x201c;I have become a dog.&#x201d; He was greeted with the Klaxon voice of the postwoman. She made occasional trips out to the development, seemingly as and when she felt it worth her while. He didn&#x2019;t know what happened to the mail between being sent and being delivered, if it languished in a sorting office somewhere or if the postwoman herself kept it all in her flat. He imagined her rooms filled with crates of mail, sacks of other people&#x2019;s special offers and exclusive opportunities stuffed under her bed.</p> <p>There was never anything much in the post that he wanted anyway. He shuffled down to the lobby for something to do and collected the pile from his mailbox, dropping each envelope after a cursory glance&#x2014;Vodafone bill, Endesa bill, Santander statement&#x2014;and then he stopped. He examined the pale-blue envelope closely before opening it.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Eamonn,</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you? I hope well. All is fine here. Anne came over last week to help clear the last of your mother&#x2019;s things. I&#x2019;m glad now that it&#x2019;s done; I&#x2019;d been putting it off for too long.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#x2019;re no doubt wondering what spirit has moved me to write, so I will get down to brass tacks. I&#x2019;m not getting any younger and I have to accept that I could follow your mother any day now, and it&#x2019;s high time I crossed off some of those things on the &#x201c;to do&#x201d; list.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t know if you remember John Nolan (son of Eugene), but he works in Harp Travel now and has sorted out flights and tickets for me. I&#x2019;ll be arriving at the airport in Almer�a at nine in the morning on 7 June.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don&#x2019;t be going to any bother on my account; I&#x2019;m well used to taking care of myself. I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing you and Laura and getting my first taste of &#x201c;abroad.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best wishes,</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your dad</p> <p>The bright sun on the pale paper was blinding. His father&#x2019;s looping blue words floated up off the page into the air around him like dust motes. He moved away from the window and read it again. He found himself fixing on irrelevancies like who John Nolan might be or how Harp Travel could still be in business. He would phone his father later and tell him to cancel the trip. He started thinking of gentle excuses.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Dermot sat near the front of the bus and studied the passing landscape. Near the airport, everything was huge. He saw elevated advertising billboards and vast storage facilities, all on the scale of the airport itself, as if airplanes, not cars, might be passing along the road. Farther on, the landscape broke down into a cluttered mishmash that he found hard to process. Small, scrappy agricultural plots with shacks made of plastic crates and tarpaulin huddled in the shadow of mirrored-glass buildings and their empty car parks. He looked at the graffiti under every overpass&#x2014;colorful images as complicated and jumbled as the landscape around them, huge letters with teeth and eyes spelling strange words and names. He saw the same poster for a circus over and over again and later passed the circus itself in the middle of a parched field. The word &#x201c;Alegr�a&#x201d; was written in lights above the entrance.</p> <p>At the terminus, he asked if the driver spoke English and she said a little. Eamonn&#x2019;s place was unmarked on the map. A new town. Purpose-built. There was just a small cross in biro that Eamonn had made for his mother before he left. Dermot tried the name of it anyway on the driver, and when she looked blank he was unsure if it was his pronunciation or the obscurity of the place. He pointed on the map to where he was heading, and she shook her head and blew air as if trying to whistle. She opened her window and called to the driver of a bus parked across the street. She turned back to Dermot.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is very far. Difficult.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bus T-237 to here.&#x201d; She indicated a point on the map a little distance from Eamonn&#x2019;s cross. &#x201c;<i>Despu�s</i> . . .&#x201d; She blew air through her lips again and shrugged. &#x201c;Taxi?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right. Thank you very much.&#x201d; He hesitated and then said, &#x201c;<i>Gracias</i>.&#x201d; The driver smiled and showed him where to get the bus.</p> <p>He took his time walking through the town, looking in the windows of the shops he passed. He saw one that seemed to sell only slippers and another one just pajamas. At the baker&#x2019;s he paused and studied the display before deciding to enter. Inside, he found he was a good foot and a half taller than any of the other customers. Some of the women turned to look at him, and he gave each a brief nod of his head. There was no queue that he could discern, but the two women behind the counter seemed to know in which order to serve everyone. When it came to his turn, he pointed at a stick of bread filled with ham and cheese and bought some kind of milk shake as well. He took them out into the street and ate them while waiting for the bus, enjoying the warmth of the sun seeping through his clothes.</p> <p>Time: 43:08; Moves: 579. Two kings were trapped behind the seven of clubs. He shifted cards from the ace piles and back again, treading water while the clock ticked on. Just visible on the screen, above the top-right corner of the simulated green baize, a folder of students&#x2019; work sat unmarked. He glanced at it periodically and then back at the cards. There were different ways to traverse the vast floes of time.</p> <p>He found himself staring at the blinking cursor, unsure how long he had been doing so. His body had become synced with the cursor&#x2019;s rhythm: the ebb and flow of his blood, the throb of his heart, the pulse of his headache. When his eyes finally refocused, it was upon the date display. He stared at it for some time, finding it distantly familiar, before reaching for his father&#x2019;s letter.</p> <p>He stood up quickly, feeling dizzy, thrashing about in search of the car keys before running into the street. The hot breath of the Toyota threatened to suffocate him as he climbed inside. He turned the key and the engine clicked. He did it again and again, as if the act of turning the key could somehow recharge the battery. He got out to breathe and kick the car like a child, and then he was still.</p> <p>On the second leg of the journey, the landscape was unvaried. He saw nothing for miles but great expanses of polytunnels, the entire countryside hidden behind wrapping. Occasionally he&#x2019;d glimpse a field apparently abandoned, its plastic covering ripped open and hanging in sheets as if the crops inside had escaped during the night. For a long time he could detect no evidence of humanity, but gradually his eyes adjusted to the rhythm of the landscape and he began to spot makeshift shacks huddled next to the vast plastic tunnels, T-shirts and jeans hanging from washing lines, plastic garden furniture, a solitary young black man crouching in the shade.</p> <p>The bus dropped him near the junction to the road that led to Eamonn&#x2019;s village. From the map it looked to be about four miles by that road, but he saw there was a more direct route over the hills. He had always been a walker, often finding himself walking his bus routes on days off, investigating more closely things he had been able only to glimpse from the driver&#x2019;s cab. As he climbed the main slope now, even with the footing a little tricky in parts, he realized how much he had missed decent hills like these and the feeling of his blood moving quickly around his body.</p> <p>Eamonn&#x2019;s apartment was in the upper reaches of Lomaverde, at the rear of the development, or the &#x201c;urbanization,&#x201d; as some of the other expats called it in a strange mangling of the Spanish. His block was at the end of the street; beyond its sidewall lay nothing but steep-rising, bare scrubland, optimistically described as &#x201c;impressive mountain scenery&#x201d; in the sales particulars. Now, leaning against the car, paralyzed by indecision, he glimpsed something in the distance on the hillside. He looked again and saw that it was a human figure. Nobody approached Lomaverde from the hill. Visitors, such as they were, came along the winding road from the town. The burglaries had stopped, but they all remained suspicious of strangers. He shielded his eyes with his hands and looked up toward the black shape.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Dermot had grown used to the sparseness of the landscape on the climb: slopes of arid white soil, broken up with wild rosemary. When he reached the top, he saw the broad expanse of the Mediterranean stretched out before him. The deep blue seemed to rinse his eyes of the grittiness they&#x2019;d had since boarding the plane that morning. The water appeared completely still and he stood, equally still, his breathing slowing, fully absorbed by the color below him. He thought of the spray as you walked along the promenade in Lahinch and remembered, for the first time in many years, the taste of seaweed from a bag.</p> <p>It was only now that he noticed the development below, between him and the sea. He wasn&#x2019;t sure at first what it was. The gleaming white cubes looked somehow scientific in purpose, a collection of laboratories or observatories perhaps. It was a few moments before he realized that what he was looking at was Eamonn&#x2019;s village. The neat white boxes, curving black roads, and lush green lawns stood out sharply against the dusty ridge. From where he stood, the sun bouncing off the sea, a heat haze shimmering around its edges, Lomaverde looked like a mirage.</p> <p>The man was carrying something and shouting. All Eamonn could catch was a single repeated word that sounded like &#x201c;<i>Llover</i>,&#x201d; and he wondered if this was some strange wandering weatherman come to warn them all of rain. It was Eamonn&#x2019;s legs that recognized him first. They started moving, seemingly independent of his will, up the slope, his ears finally unscrambling the words correctly:</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello there! Eamonn!&#x201d; He had just a moment to register the incongruity of his father&#x2019;s presence there on the blazing hillside, dressed in a light woolen jacket, carrying his Aston Villa holdall, before they were standing facing each other, Dermot smiling shyly and saying, as if it were the most normal thing in the world:</p> <p>&#x201c;And how are you, son?&#x201d;<br>Copyright � 2013 by Catherine O'Flynn</p></p><h2>For Your Own Good</h2><p>Alice Miller explores the sources of violence within ourselves and the way these are encouraged by orthodox childrearing practices. Challenging the way in which we rationalise punishment and coercion as being for the child&#39;s &#39;own good&#39;, she illuminates the cost in compassion and humanity in later life, both in the private and public domain. Her message is clear: &#39;people whose integrity has not been damaged in childhood; will feel no need to harm another person or themselves.&#39;</p><p>Miller explores the backgrounds of extreme cases of self-destructive and violent individuals to further her theories on longterm consequences of abusive childrearing. Her conclusions about what creates a drug addict, a murderer, even a Hitler, stray far from psychoanalytic dogma about human nature. Miller paints a jolting picture of the violent world each generation helps shape when traditional upbringing, with its hidden cruelty, is perpetuated. She also offers a way out by striving to resensitize the child in the adult, to unlock an emotional life frozen in repression.Alice Miller is one of the leading authorities on the causes and consequences of child-abuse and is the author of numerous books on the subject.</p><h2>Ancient Greek Art (Art In History)</h2><p>Explore Greek art across the ages.

Painting, mosaic, pottery, architecture, and sculpture are all introduced, with some of the most prominent examples chosen to illustrate and expand upon the narrative. Lengthy captions for the photographs and illustrations provide additional information. Fact boxes are interspersed to clarify points of history and/or art. Words in bold face are defined in a brief glossary; illustrations are included in the index. There are some inconsistencies; e.g., the word "encaustic" is defined in the texts rather than in the glossaries, and a few dates in the narratives that don't appear in the concluding time lines. In Roman Art, a tool called a "groma" is referred to and yet there is no picture or description of one. Both titles show a "color palette," but don't include all of the colors that are used in the works of art shown. Despite these minor faults, the books contain a great deal of excellent information, are well organized and easy to read, and would be solid purchases for introducing the art of these two ancient cultures.</p><p><i>Marilyn Fairbanks, East Junior High School, Brockton, MA</i></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Harold&#39;s Purple Crayon Adventures: 6 Picture Book Box Set</h2><p>Six classic books and a two-sided poster featuring Harold and his purple crayon.

Among other things this volume includes: impressive images from a seemingly far distant time, which is actually not long ago ... It has been said of Oman that its &#39;Middle Ages ended in 1970&#39; Certainly before the accession of Sultan Qaboos little had changed in the country&#39;s outward aspect for many generations. W.D. Peyton, an Arabist with a deep knowledge and love of Oman, has painstakingly amassed a stunning record of the country as it used to be. The result is a truly fascinating series of pictures of a world now utterly transformed. Old Oman will intrigue anyone whose knowledge of the country began in more recent years, and will enhance the recollections of those with a longer acquaintance with the country. Why it took so long to rise to prominence remains a mystery but its era of prosperity seems to have depended on control by a strong political authority with international connections, whether that be Portuguese or Omani. Some Gulf ports were sustained essentially by an economic hinterland. Muscat&#39;s success was due to political factors as much or more than a hinterland. This was a significant contributing factor in its truly cosmopolitan nature. As an example of that cosmopolitanism, it was said at the beginning of the twen- tieth century that 14 languages were spoken regularly in the suqs of Muscat and Matrah.1 It may be surmised that just as many were spoken for centuries before that and indeed are spoken today.</p><p>W.D. Peyton first went to the Middle East in 1946 to teach at an American secondary school in Damascus. After learning Arabic in Cairo and after a stint with the Quakers among the Palestine refugees at Gaza, he went to Jeddah as representative of J. Paul Getty. He has also worked for Aramco in Saudi Arabia, The Economist in England, and Shell in London, Libya, and Oman. He and his wife lived in Oman for many years and he still visits regularly.</p><h2>Development of Southern Sectionalism, 1819-1848 (A History of the South)</h2><p><p>Includes: The South, 1819--1848: A Critical Essay on Recent Worksby Edwin A. Miles, 1968</p><p>This book is Volume V of A History of the South, a ten-volume series designed to present a thoroughly balanced history of all the complex aspects of the South's culture from 1607 to the present. Like its companion volumes, The Development of Southern Sectionalism was written by an outstanding student of Southern history.</p><p>What caused the South's growing self-consciousness as a region? Professor Sydnor here deals with two major aspects of the problem. One is the internal development of the South. Sydnor's analysis of local and state governments provides the clue to the mainsprings of political action, and he studies the motives behind programs for economic and humanitarian reform, the trends in education, salve trading, the Indian removal, and westward expansion. The other more somber theme is the deterioration of the South's relationship to the nation: the loss of its position of political leadership, its attempts to invent political defenses for its minority position, and the gradual substitution of a sectional for a national patriotism.</p><p> In this period were laid the foundations for the fateful conflict that was to follow. Sydnor's thoughtful study suggests fresh interpretations for the Missouri Compromise, the origins and significance of nullification; and his deep insight into the development of sectionalism during the 1820s makes this volume indispensable to an understanding of the South.</p></p><p><p></p><br><br><p>Charles S. Sydnor was professor of history at Duke University at the time of his death in 1954. He had previously served as professor of history at Hampden-Sydney College and the University of Mississippi and had also taught at Emory and Cornell Universities. A one-time president of the Southern Historical Association, he served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Southern History and the Southern Altantic Quarterly. He was the author of Slavery in Mississippi and A Gentleman of the Old Natchez Region: Benjamin L.C. Wailes. He also contributed twenty-three biographical sketches to the Dictionary of American Biography and numerous articles to historical journals. After his death the Sydnor Prize for the best book in the field of Southern history was established by the Southern Historical Association.</p></p><h2>Birds Without Wings</h2><p>Set against the backdrop of the collapsing Ottoman Empire, the Gallipoli campaign and the subsequent bitter struggle between Greeks and Turks, &#34;Birds Without Wings&#34; traces the fortunes of one small community in south-west Anatolia - a town in which Christian and Muslim lives and traditions have co-existed peacefully for centuries. When war is declared and the outside world intrudes, the twin scourges of religion and nationalism lead to forced marches and massacres, and the peaceful fabric of life is destroyed. Philothei, a Christian girl of legendary beauty, and Ibrahim the Goatherd who has courted her since infancy are but two of the many casualties. With the end of a community that once transcended religious differences, their great love seems destined to end in tragedy and madness...</p><p>In his first novel since Corelli&#39;s Mandolin,&#34; Louis de Bernieres creates a world, populates it with characters as real as our best friends, and launches it into the maelstrom of twentieth-century history. The setting is a small village in southwestern Anatolia in the waning years of the Ottoman Empire. Everyone there speaks Turkish, though they write it in Greek letters. It&#39;s a place that has room for a professional blasphemer; where a brokenhearted aga finds solace in the arms of a Circassian courtesan who isn&#39;t Circassian at all; where a beautiful Christian girl named Philothei is engaged to a Muslim boy named Ibrahim. But all of this will change when Turkey enters the modern world. Epic in sweep, intoxicating in its sensual detail, Birds Without Wings is an enchantment.Louis de Bernieres is the best-selling author of Captain Corelli&#39;s Mandolin. His most recent novels are Birds Without Wings and A Partisan&#39;s Daughter.</p><h2>Solar Electricity Basics: A Green Energy Guide</h2><p><p>The future will be powered by renewables.

The first, suggested by much that was said at the Nuremberg Trials, was to discover how great a part Hitler played in the history of the Third Reich and whether G�ring and the other defendants were exaggerating when they claimed that under the Nazi regime the will of one man, and of one man alone, was decisive. This led to the second and larger question: if the picture of Hitler given at Nuremberg was substantially accurate, what were the gifts Hitler possessed which enabled him first to secure and then to maintain such power. Author Bullock determined to reconstruct, so far as he was able, the course of Hitler&#x2019;s life from his birth in 1889 to his death in 1945, in the hope that this would enable him to offer an account of one of the most puzzling and remarkable careers in modern history. The book is cast, therefore, in the form of a historical narrative, interrupted only at one point by a chapter in which the author has tried to present a portrait of Hitler on the eve of his greatest triumphs (Chapter 7). Bullock notes that he has not attempted to write a history of Germany, nor a study of government and society under the Nazi regime. His theme is not dictatorship, but the dictator, the personal power of one man, although it may be added that for most of the years between 1933 and 1945 this is identical with the most important part of the history of the Third Reich. The bibliography printed at the end sets out the sources on which this study is based. In the ten years since this book was first published much new material has appeared which throws light on the history of the Nazi Party and the Third Reich. The author has taken the opportunity of a new edition to make a thorough revision of the whole text, taking this material into account and, where it seemed necessary, rewriting in order to make use of it.</p><p>Alan Bullock, Baron Bullock, was born in 1914. He studied at Oxford University and served as a research assistant to Winston Churchill while writing his A History of the English-Speaking Peoples. He was a history fellow at New College, Oxford, helped found St Catherine&#39;s College, Oxford, and was Vice-Chancellor for the university. A renowned modern historian, Bullock was made a life peer in 1976. He died in 2004.</p><h2>Through the Animals&#39; Eyes: A Story of the First Christmas</h2><p>From dogs watching over the shepherds&#39; flocks when angels appear, to a charmed cobra performing in Herod&#39;s court as the king tries to deceive the wise men, Wormell&#39;s trademark animal imagery brings a new perspective to the story of the first Christmas.</p><p><b>Christopher Wormell</b> is the celebrated English wood engraver whose illustrated books are collected and loved throughout the world.

He closed his eyes and let out a low breath.<br><br><em>Crash.</em><br><br>Jonas shot into a sitting position as his blood pounded through his veins.<br><br>That wasn't the house settling. Someone was <em>in</em> his house. Upstairs.<br><br><em>Felix!</em> He had to get to Felix, his thirteen-year-old son. He froze, his thoughts scrambling. No. Wait. It was Saturday night. Felix was sleeping over at a friend's. A flash of relief, then determination made his heart kick up speed.<br><br>Who was it? What did the intruder want? Money? Jewelry? Moving as silently as possible, Jonas rose from the recliner and stood, fingers clenching and unclenching at his sides.<br><br>A weapon.<br><br>He needed to be able to defend himself. Where was his phone? He had to call for help. And get out.<br><br>The stairs creaked. He stopped at the edge of the room.<br><br>To get to either the front door or the back, he would have to go through the kitchen. Which meant passing the stairs.<br><br>While his adrenaline pounded, Jonas thought hard. His cell phone was on the kitchen counter. He didn't have a landline.<br><br>Soft footfalls on the steps reached his ears as though someone didn't want to make a lot of noise, but wasn't very skilled at being quiet.<br><br>Jonas grabbed the nearest thing he could use as a weapon from the built-in shelf. Felix's track meet trophy, his son's pride and joy. Hefting it in his left hand, he decided to bolt for the kitchen, grab his phone from the counter and keep going out the back door. He'd avoid a confrontation if at all possible but he needed to get help on the way.<br><br>Grab the phone, get out and call for help. A good plan. He slipped past the bottom of the steps, praying the darkness hid him from whoever was on them. In the kitchen, moonlight filtering from the window over the sink illuminated the way.<br><br>The f loor creaked behind him.<br><br>A hard hand centered itself in the middle of his back and a hard shove propelled him into the kitchen table. Jonas bounced, stumbled and crashed into the refrigerator. Felix's trophy tumbled from his fingers. Fury boiled through him and he spun, striking out, praying to hit something. He landed a hard fist on his attacker's face.<br><br>A hiss of surprise and a curse reached his ears.<br><br>Jonas managed to grab the trophy once more. Then the feel of something hard and cold against his left cheek froze him. "I have a son," he whispered. "He needs me."<br><br>"Give me the phone."<br><br>"What phone?" Jonas clutched the trophy, his mind racing.<br><br>"Give me the phone!"<br><br>The weapon moved, slipping from his cheek. Jonas brought the base of the heavy trophy up and moved sideways at the same time. He connected with the attacker's stomach, heard a whoosh, then the gun clattering on the floor. The man cursed, swept his hand out and grabbed the gun. Jonas swung the trophy once more, connected. The intruder gave a harsh cry and bolted for the door.<br><br>Jonas panted and rose to go after him. Then thought of his son and stopped.<br><br>He grabbed his cell phone from the counter and dialed 911.<br><br>Brooke Clark pushed the laptop away and rubbed her gritty eyes. One in the morning and she was on her laptop? She needed to be sensible and get some sleep. But her adrenaline was still high even though her eyes longed to shut.<br><br>She'd just walked in the door an hour ago from a crime scene where Mercy, her very skilled K-9 golden retriever, had done her job well. She'd recovered some key evidence in a bank robbery and once testing was done on the glove, Brooke knew the DNA would put the criminal away.<br><br>Unfortunately, sleep would have to wait. She groaned, settled into the recliner and decided to keep working on the case that had caused her and her team no end of frustration.<br><br>Congressman Harland Jeffries continued to pound home the fact that his son's murder still wasn't solved. Late one night two months ago, someone had killed Michael Jeffries. Michael wasn't just the congressman's son, but was also a well-respected lawyer. The congressman had come upon the scene, his son on the ground, shot, and the murderer standing over Michael's body. The killer had turned the gun on the congressman and shot him, leaving him for dead. Only Harland hadn't died. He'd lived to tell the story and demand justice for his son. Unfortunately, darkness had prevented the congressman from seeing the murderer's face, so the hunt was still on to find the person responsible.<br><br>She and the other members of the Capitol K-9 team wouldn't be granted rest until the case was solved. Brooke loved her job, but frustration built at the lack of progress when it came to finding answers. She flipped the page in the file. Rosa Gomez, Congressman Jeffries's housekeeper, was also connected to the case. Shortly before the shooting, Rosa had been found dead at the base of the cliffs in President's Park. "Which hasn't been technically proved to be murder. It could have been an accident," she told Mercy. The dog yawned, then gave a low whine and nudged against her hand. The animal's affection made her smile and run her hand over Mercy's silky soft ears.<br><br>Mercy, her sweet&#x2014;and super smart&#x2014;golden retriever.<br><br>Highly trained, Mercy and Brooke were partners in the elite Capitol K-9 Unit based in Washington, DC. Mercy specialized in retrieving evidence. Brooke sighed. She wished there were some evidence to be retrieved in either Michael Jeffries's murder or Rosa Gomez's death. "It's all right, girl. Just because I'm up doesn't mean you have to lose out on a good night's sleep." Mercy heaved a sigh and settled at Brooke's feet. Then rose to pad to the door and back.<br><br>"You're restless, too, huh?" Brooke got up from the recliner and went to open the door for Mercy. The dog bounded into the fenced yard, and Brooke stared out into the dark night. She shivered at the chill. March was a cold month in DC, and Brooke hadn't grabbed her coat. She watched Mercy sniff and weave in and out of the bushes lining the fence. The trees beyond offered a sense of privacy and security, one of the reasons Brooke had purchased the home.<br><br>She pulled the door shut behind her and sat on the cement steps, wrapping her arms around her middle. Maybe the cold would revive some of her dead brain cells. Her thoughts were like a dog with a bone. She couldn't keep her mind from gnawing on the Jeffries case.<br><br>Harland Jeffries was about to push Gavin, her captain, over the edge. Gavin was a good man, a professional in every sense of the word. Brooke respected how he had managed to hold on to his temper when it came to the congressman's incessant demands on Gavin's time. She stood. "Mercy, come."<br><br>The dog bounded over to her and sat at her feet, ears perked. Brooke gave those ears a good rub and let the dog back into the house. Poor Gavin. He was really torn. She knew he was between a rock and a hard place. He had a lot of respect for the congressman. Harland had been a mentor to Gavin, and Gavin loved the man like a father. It was tearing him up not to be able to give him some answers.<br><br>She forced herself to head to bed. She'd count sheep if she had to. Or review the case notes while snuggling under the warm down comforter. Maybe then she'd doze off.<br><br>And maybe pigs would start flying.<br><br>Jonas shut the door as the police officers headed toward their squad car. He appreciated the fast response to his 911 call, but the officers had basically checked out the scene, taken a few pictures of the dumped drawer in Felix's room, then told him to be thankful he wasn't hurt and nothing was missing. Oh, and to call if anything else happened.<br><br>Right.<br><br>He sighed and reached back to massage the area at the base of his skull. He needed a vacation. A stress-reducing getaway. But Felix was in school for another three weeks before his spring break.<br><br>Maybe then.<br><br>He trudged up the stairs to Felix's room and took another look around. The drawer on the floor, the unmade bed, an unfinished 3-D puzzle of the capitol building. He sighed and picked up Felix's favorite sweatshirt and tossed it across the footboard of the bed. A pair ofjeans and a hoodie joined the sweatshirt.<br><br>His eyes caught on the picture on his son's nightstand. Felix had been about two years old. He was laughing up at Shannon, his mother and Jonas's ex-wife. It had been a happy time in his young life, Jonas's life, too. Neither Felix nor Jonas had known the trouble that would come just a few short years away. Trouble brought on by Shannon and her commitment-phobic ways.<br><br>Jonas sighed, flipped off the light and headed to his own room. He crawled between the sheets, forcing his muscles to relax, his mind to drift into prayer. Until he remembered the crash he heard. The drawer to Felix's nightstand had been yanked out and dumped. His heart thudded. The officers had come to the same conclusion he had. The intruder had already been in his house when he'd arrived home. Either the man hadn't heard him come in and drop into the recliner&#x2014;or he hadn't cared and just continued his search.<br><br>Jonas debated whether to get up and clean up the drawer or wait until later.<br><br>It would wait. He drifted. Sleep beckoned.<br><br>At least until the strange beeping jerked him awake again.<br><br>Jonas sat straight up, his adrenaline spiking once more. Heart thundering in his chest, he grabbed the baseball bat he'd placed on the floor near his bed and swung his legs over the side. He stood and padded on bare feet to the door.<br><br>The faint beeping sounded again. Then all was silent.<br><br>Jonas's fingers flexed around the bat. He grabbed his cell phone with his left hand and shoved it into the waistband of his knit shorts.<br><br>More beeping.<br><br>Jonas followed the sound into his son's bedroom two doors down from his. He stood in the doorway and listened.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>And then he heard it again. Louder this time. He was definitely closer.<br><br>Jonas flipped the light on and blinked against the sudden brightness. When his eyes adjusted, he dropped to his knees on the hardwood floors and scanned the area under Felix's dresser. Finding nothing, he rose and moved to his son's bedside table. The drawer still lay on its side. He grabbed the small flashlight and went to his knees once again.<br><br>Jonas flashed the light under the bed. The beeping sounded right next to his ear. He lifted the mattress, separating it from the box springs, and froze, puzzled. A cell phone? He snagged it and dropped the mattress back into place. Fingers curled around the phone, he lifted it up to study it. "Who does this belong to?" he muttered. One of Felix's friends? But why would Felix have it hidden under his mattress? Had he stolen it?<br><br>Jonas snapped the light off and carried the phone into his bedroom. He flipped on the lamp and sank onto the bed, his eyes still on the device. Low battery. Hence the beeping.<br><br>He touched the screen to bring the phone to life. A picture stared back at him. A woman holding a baby. He frowned as recognition hit him. He knew that woman. He'd seen her on the news, hadn't he? And in the papers. He got up and strode into the kitchen to grab the newspaper from the counter.<br><br>There. Right on the front page. Housekeeper for Congressman Harland Jeffries, Rosa Gomez had been found at the bottom of the cliffs in President's Park approximately two months ago and the investigation continued to make front-page news as new evidence came to light. The Capitol K-9 Unit had been working the case and the story had stayed hot, the media constantly reminding everyone that this case hadn't been solved yet.<br><br>And someone had just broken into his house looking for a phone. He stared at the device. Could he have been looking for this one?<br><br>His thoughts went immediately to Brooke Clark, a Capitol K-9 Unit team member who was working the case.<br><br>An officer and a beautiful woman. He pushed aside the personal thoughts and focused on what to do about this phone. Right now, he couldn't worry about how Felix had gotten ahold of it, he had to turn it in.<br><br>And he knew just the person he wanted to give it to.<br><br>Brooke jerked out of the light sleep she'd managed to fall into sometime between her last sip of warm tea and a prayer for divine help in solving her case. She rolled to grab her phone from the end table. "'Lo?"<br><br>"I woke you up. I'm sorry."<br><br>Sleep fled. She sat up. "Jonas Parker?" Her heart stuttered. Just saying his name brought back a f lood of memories. Both wonderful and...painful. Along with boatloads of regret. The same feelings that rushed through her every time she saw or spoke to him. Which hadn't been too long ago. Maybe a month? Amazing that she had no trouble pulling the memory of his voice from the depths of her tired mind. But then why would she? She often dreamed of him, their past times together. And they hadn't even dated. Not once. She blinked. "What's wrong?"<br><br>"You're working the case about the congressman's son's death, aren't you?"<br><br>"Yes. Michael Jeffries." She cleared her throat. "You called me at four o'clock in the morning to ask that?"<br><br>"No, I called to tell you that I think I found something that you might need for your investigation."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"A phone with a picture of Rosa Gomez and her two-year-old son as the wallpaper."<br><br>Fully awake now, Brooke swung her legs over the edge of the bed. At the foot of the bed, Mercy lifted her head and perked her ears. "Where did you find the phone?" she asked.<br><br>The fact that Rosa's wallet and phone hadn't been found with her body had raised a lot of questions. Like had her fall from the cliffs been an accident or murder? And if it had been an accident, where were the items? And if it had been murder, had the murderer stolen them?<br><br>Another question: Was Rosa's death connected to the shooting of her boss, Congressman Jeffries, and the murder of his son? So far, they had few suspects, one being a senator's daughter, Erin Eagleton. She'd disappeared the night of the murder and her starfish charm, engraved with her initials, had been found at the scene. Brooke was glad that Rosa's child was now in the custody of his aunt, but so many questions remained. Maybe the phone Jonas had would answer some of them.<br><br>"Ah... Well, that's the problem. And one of the reasons I called you."<br><br>"Come on, Jonas, tell me."<br><br>"I found the phone under my son's mattress."</p><h2>Introducing the old testament</h2><p>John Drane&#39;s survey textbook provides an engaging general introduction to the persons, events, and cultural context of the Old Testament.

Anthony Rotundo sweeps away the groundless assumptions and myths that inform the current fascination with men's lives. Opposing the views of men's movement leaders and best-selling authors who maintain that manliness is eternal and unchanging, Rotundo stresses that our concept of manhood is man-made and that, like any human invention, it has a history. <i>American Manhood</i> is a fascinating account of how our understanding of what it means to be a man has changed over time.</p><p><b>E. Anthony Rotundo</b> teaches history and develops programs on race and gender at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.A fascinating, accessible, and meticulous piece of scholarship, this study of changing conceptions of manhood breaks new ground in uncovering the internal struggles and shifting paradigms that have informed American men's understanding of themselves. Borrowing the innovative techniques of women's history and gender studies, Rotundo (History/Phillips Academy) shines a powerful light on the diaries, letters, and institutions of white, northern, middle-class men. From a Puritan society that conceived of men largely as ranked members of a community, America, he says, was transformed into a place where a man was an individual who created his own place and status. The qualities that were valued in a man were likewise transformed, from an ideal that called for the suppression of aggressive, competitive urges to an image of manliness that valued nothing more. While boys were once seen as separate from men--at times, more like females; later, as a host of antisocial impulses that need to be suppressed--by the end of the 19th century, men (with Theodore Roosevelt as paradigm) were seen as overgrown boys, their boyish impulses being their best part. Similarly, men's relation to women, while never abjuring the underlying framework of gender spheres, has repeatedly shifted to buttress men's superiority. Sexuality, too, Rotundo says, has changed profoundly, and not always in ways we would think: The 18th century lacked a true concept of homosexuality, allowing adult male friends to spend the night in each others' arms--an act inconceivable to most contemporary heterosexuals. While the slice of society Rotundo examines is narrow, what he reveals goes deep. A pioneering work. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Tensions have heightened among the various tribes and news arrives of a potential attack on the hunters, forcing Hemingway not only to take on his new role of leader but, equally important, to assist his wife Mary i</p><p>Ernest Hemingway's final posthumous work bears the rather awkward designation "a fictional memoir" and arrives under a cloud of controversial editing and patching--but all of that ends up being beside the point. Though this account of a 1953 safari in Kenya lacks the resolution and clarity of the best Hemingway (<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>) it is "real" Hemingway nonetheless. Let scholars work out where memoir leaves off and fiction begins: for the common reader, the prose alone casts an irresistible spell. <p> In <i>True at First Light</i> the glory days of the "great white hunters" are over and the Mau Mau rebellion is violently dislodging European farmers from Kenya's arable lands. But to the African gun bearers, drivers, and game scouts who run his safari in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro, Hemingway remains a lordly figure--almost a god. Two parallel quests propel the narrative: Mary, Hemingway's fourth and last wife, doggedly stalks an enormous black-maned lion that she is determined to kill by Christmas, while Hemingway becomes increasingly obsessed with Debba, a beautiful young African woman. What makes the novel especially strange and compelling is that Mary knows all about Debba and accepts her as a "supplementary wife," even as she loses no opportunity to rake her husband over the coals for his drinking, lack of discipline in camp, and condescending protectiveness. </p><p> As usual with Hemingway, atmosphere and attitude are far more important than plot. Mary at one point berates her husband as a "conscience-ridden murderer," but this is precisely the moral stance that gives the hunting scenes their tension and beauty. "I was happy that before he died he had lain on the high yellow rounded mound with his tail down," Hemingway writes of "Mary's lion," "and his great paws comfortable before him and looked off across his country to the blue forest and the high white snows of the big Mountain." </p><p> Passages like these--and there are many of them--redeem the book's rambling structure and occasional lapses into self-indulgent posturing. Joan Didion dismissed <i>True at First Light</i> in <i>The New Yorker</i> as "words set down but not yet written," but this fails to acknowledge the power of these words. The value of <i>True at First Light</i> lies in its candor, its nakedness: it provides a rare opportunity to watch a master working his way toward art. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Chicago in 1899 as the son of a doctor and the second of six children. After a stint as an ambulance driver at the Italian front, Hemingway came home to America in 1919, only to return to the battlefield - this time as a reporter on the Greco-Turkish war - in 1922. Resigning from journalism to focus on his writing instead, he moved to Paris where he renewed his earlier friendship with fellow American expatriates such as Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. Through the years, Hemingway travelled widely and wrote avidly, becoming an internationally recognized literary master of his craft. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, following the publication of The Old Man and the Sea. He died in 1961.</p><h2>What Your Mother Never Told You About Sex</h2><p>A no-holds-barred guide, from a leading woman gynecologist, covers every aspect of sex, from male and female anatomy and self-care to incredible sex and sexual problems, shattering preconceived myths and distorted views about sex, and encouraging women to make their own informed decisions about sex and sexuality. 17,500 first printing.</p><p>Hilda Hutcherson, M.D., is the codirector of the New York Center for Human Sexuality at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons.

Hounded from the country of his birth, Bane found acceptance across the seas?only to have it stripped away in an instant by a cruel and deadly swordsman. Now fighting as a gladiator in the blood-soaked arenas of the Empire, Bane lives for one thing: revenge. And he pursues his goal with the same single-minded determination that won his father a crown.

The fate of human and Seidh alike will be decided by the clash of swords?and by the bonds of twisted love and bitterness between a father and a son . . .</p><p></p><h2>Meteorites</h2><p>Introduces meteorites, discussing how they break away from asteroids, how their age is determined by scientists, where they come from and why they fall to the earth, and more</p><p>YA-Small in size, this guidebook is a wonderful resource.

Whatever else he was, Count Alessandro di Cagliostro, the leader of an exotic brand of Freemasonry, was indisputably one of the most influential and notorious figures of the latter eighteenth century, overcoming poverty and an ignoble birth to become the darling -- and bane -- of upper-crust Europe.</p><p>Internationally acclaimed historian Iain McCalman has not written a work of biography in the strictest sense; rather, he uses seven key "episodes" in Cagliostro's political and spiritual evolution to provide a dazzling panoramic portrait of eighteenth-century European culture and history. McCalman documents how Cagliostro crossed paths -- and often swords -- with the likes of Catherine the Great, Marie Antoinette, and Pope Pius VI. He was a muse to William Blake and the inspiration for both Mozart's The Magic Flute and Goethe's Faust. LouisXVI had him thrown into the Bastille for his alleged involvement in what would come to be known as "the affair of the necklace." Yet in London, Warsaw, and St. Petersburg, he established "healing clinics" for the poorest of the poor, a radical notion at that time; and his dexterity in the worlds of alchemy and spiritualism won him acclaim among the nobility across Europe.</p><p>But it was his progress through the rites of Egyptian Freemasonry -- including the Illuminati, a genuinely conspiratorial secret society dedicated to the overthrow of established religion and monarchy -- that was both his highest achievement and his undoing. In 1791, on the order of Pope Pius VI, Cagliostro was arrested for heresy. He spent the last five years of his life in solitary confinement in an Italian prison, where he died in 1795.</p></p><p><p>Iain McCalman was born in Nyasaland (now Malawi) in Africa in 1947. Although a third-generation African - his family is descended in part from Australians who fought with the Australian Light Horse in the Boer War - McCalman grew up knowing he would eventually have to leave Africa. His father, a Kenyan-raised British civil servant, "was very liberal for his time", says McCalman. "He always told us European colonials were caretakers, not owners, and we'd have to go one day. It really irritated my sister and me. Africa was our home. But he never bought property, always prepared us to leave."</p><p>At around the age of sixteen he began writing: "My first publication was an article in the <em>Rhodesia Herald</em> on early Portuguese exploration of the lands that now include Zimbabwe." McCalman says he grew up in Africa "in a context where people around me believed in magic, and I felt sympathy with that without it penetrating my own beliefs". This, he believes, was an advantage in writing about Cagliostro's life and work.</p><p>He migrated to Australia, where he completed his BA Hons in History and MA at Canberra's Australian National University, and his PhD at Melbourne's Monash University. He has worked in many Australian and overseas universities, and has received awards for his teaching and scholarship, most recently the Federation Centenary medal in 2002. Currently President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, McCalman became a Professor in History in 1994 and Director of the Humanities Research Centre at ANU a year later. He is currently a Federation Fellow at the ANU - one of the few humanities recipients - and will use the fellowship to research a multi-media project on the "moving picture spectacles" of 18th-century painter (and key Cagliostro enemy) Philip de Loutherborg, and a history of the impact of spectacular Australian landscapes on scientists in Darwin's age. </p><p>Iain McCalman specializes in eighteenth-century and early-nineteenth British and European cultural history and has a particular interest in popular culture and "low life".</p><p>Along with his many academic achievements, McCalman has developed an interest in the uses of other media for history and has been active in developing collaborative projects linking university-based research to the work of other cultural institutions, and recently was a historical consultant for and participant in the television series <em>The Ship,</em> a re-enactment of Cook's <em>Endeavou</em>r voyage. "I had to snatch my reading during occasional interludes between climbing 140 feet up the rigging, sleeping like a fruit bat in a hammock, and crunching on hard tack biscuits and sauerkraut," he says of the journey, and admits it was a little bit "<em>Big Brother</em> at sea". </p><p>He is also writing a travel-book cum political memoir called <em>The Gun in the Lake</em>, based on his early life and experiences in Nyasaland.</p>Cultural historian McCalman (editor, An Oxford Companion to the Romantic Age) presents an enlightening account of the career of one of the most famous charlatans of the 18th century, Count Alessandro di Cagliostro. He was born poor, in 1743, in Sicily, where he began his career as a petty street thug. Setting the pattern for the rest of his life, Cagliostro was forced to flee Sicily after defrauding a local merchant. He traveled all over Europe, usually one step ahead of the authorities, spreading his brand of Freemasonry and billing himself as an alchemist and healer. Tremendously charismatic, he gained legions of followers. In Russia, he tried to convert Catherine the Great to Freemasonry, but she viewed him as politically subversive and harried him out of the country. Cagliostro's journeys finally brought him to Italy, where he was hounded as a fake by the newspapers. The amorous adventurer Casanova described Cagliostro as a fraud who fleeced the gullible. While in Italy, his wife, Seraphina, grew tired of all the traveling and the constant bad publicity, and betrayed him to the Inquisition, which, shocked by his Freemasonry and his claims to have supernatural powers, sentenced him to life in prison; he died there in 1795. McCalman's account is adeptly researched and written with a light, charming touch; as the author makes abundantly clear, the Age of Reason was also an age of mysticism and downright quackery. 26 b&amp;w illus. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rift in the Sky: Stratification #3</h2><p>Despite good intentions, the Om-ray of Cersi can&#39;t resist moving through space using the M-hir dimension.
